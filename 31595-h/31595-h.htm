<h3>I</h3>

<p>"Stephen K. Lepper, Pork-Packing Prince, from
Chicago, U. S. A., by White Star Line, for Liverpool."
Such was the announcement with which the <i>Chicago
Central Advertiser</i> made beautiful its list of arrivals
and departures.</p>

<p>It was not exactly a definition of him. To be sure,
if you had caught sight of him anywhere down the
sumptuous vista of the first-class sleeping-saloon of the
New York and Chicago Express, you would have judged
it adequate and inquired no more. You might even
have put him down for a Yankee.</p>

<p>But if, following him on this side of the Atlantic,
you had found yourself boxed up with him in a third-class
compartment on the London and North-western
Railway, your curiosity would have been aroused. The
first thing you would have noticed was that everything
about him, from his gray traveling hat to the gold
monogram on his portmanteau, was brilliantly and conspicuously
new. Accompanied by a lady, it would have
suggested matrimony and the grand tour. But there
was nothing else to distract you from him. He let
himself be looked at; he sat there in his corner seat,
superbly, opulently still. And somehow it dawned on
you that, in spite of some Americanisms he let fall, he
was not, and never could have been, a Yankee. He
had evidently forged ahead at a tremendous speed, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
it was weight, not steam, that did it. He belonged to
the race that bundles out on the uphill grade and puts
its shoulders to the wheel, and on the down grade tucks
its feet in, sits tight, and lets the thing fly, trusting
twenty stone to multiply the velocity.</p>

<p>Then it would occur to you that he must have been
sitting still for a considerable period. He was not stout&mdash;you
might even have called him slender; but the
muscles about his cheeks and chin hung a little loose
from the bony framework, and his figure, shapely
enough when he stood upright, yielded in a sitting posture
to the pressure of the railway cushions. That indicated
muscular tissue, once developed by outdoor
exercise, and subsequently deteriorated by sedentary
pursuits. The lines on his forehead suggested that he
was now a brain-worker of sorts.</p>

<p>Other lines showed plainly that, though his accessories
were new, the man, unlike his portmanteau, had
knocked about the world, and had got a good deal
damaged in the process. The index and middle fingers
of the left hand were wanting. You argued, then, that
he had changed his trade more than once; while from
the presence of two vertical creases on either side of a
large and rather fleshy mouth, worn as it were by the
pull of a bit, you further inferred that the energy he
must have displayed somewhere was a thing of will
rather than of temperament. He was a paradox, a
rolling stone that had unaccountably contrived to
gather moss.</p>

<p>And then you fell to wondering how so magnificently
mossy a person came to be traveling third-class in his
native country.</p>

<p>To all these problems, which did actually perplex
the clergyman, his fellow-passenger, he himself provided
the answer.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>He had taken out his gold watch with a critical air,
and timed the run from Liverpool to Crewe.</p>

<p>"Better service of trains than they used to have,"
he observed. "Same old snorer of an engine, though."</p>

<p>"You seem to know the line."</p>

<p>"It's not the first time I've ridden by it; nor yet the
first time I've crossed the herring-pond."</p>

<p>"Are you making any stay in this country?"</p>

<p>"I am, sir."</p>

<p>He lapsed into meditation evidently not unpleasing;
then he continued: "When you've got a mother and
two sisters that you haven't seen for over fifteen years,
naturally you're not in such a particular durned hurry
to get away."</p>

<p>"Your home is in America, I presume?"</p>

<p>"My home is in England. I've made my pile out
there, sir, and I've come to stay. Like to see the <i>Chicago
Advertiser</i>? It may amuse you."</p>

<p>The clergyman accepted the paper gratefully. It
did amuse him. So much so that he read aloud several
paragraphs, among others the one beginning "Stephen
K. Lepper, Pork-packing Prince."</p>

<p>It was a second or two before the horror of the situation
dawned on him. That dawn must have been reflected
on his face, for his fellow-passenger began to
snigger.</p>

<p>"Ah," said he, "you've tumbled to it. Sorry you
spoke? Don't apologize for smiling, sir. I can smile,
myself, now; but the first time I saw that paragraph
it turned me pretty faint and green. That's the way
they do things out there. Of course," he added, "I <i>had</i>
to be put in; but I'm no more like a prince than I'm
like a pork-packer."</p>

<p>What was he like? With the flush on his cheeks
the laughter in his eyes he might have been an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
enormous schoolboy home for the holidays, and genially
impudent on the strength of it.</p>

<p>"Fact is," he went on, "you didn't expect to find
such a high personage in a third-class compartment.
That put you off."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose it was that." It did seem absurd
that a pork-packing prince, who could probably have
bought up the entire rolling stock of the London and
North-western, should be traveling third.</p>

<p>"You see, I never used to go anything but third on
this old line or any other. I'm only doing it now to
make sure I'm coming home. I <i>know</i> I'm coming
home, but I want the feel of it."</p>

<p>He folded the <i>Chicago Advertiser</i> and packed it carefully
in his portmanteau. "I'm keeping this to show
my people," he explained. "It's the sort of thing that
used to make my young sister grin."</p>

<p>"You have&mdash;er&mdash;a young sister?"</p>

<p>"I had two&mdash;fifteen years ago."</p>

<p>The clergyman again looked sorry he had spoken.</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;this time. They're not dead. Only one
of them isn't quite so young as she used to be. The
best of it is, it's a surprise visit I'm paying them. They
none of them know I'm coming. I simply said I might
be turning up one of these days&mdash;before very long."</p>

<p>"They won't be sorry to have you back again, I
imagine."</p>

<p>"Sorry?"</p>

<p>He smiled sweetly and was silent for some minutes,
evidently picturing the joy, the ecstasy, of that return.
Then, feeling no doubt that the ice was broken, he
launched out into continuous narrative.</p>

<p>"Going out's all very well," he said, "but it isn't a
patch on coming home. Not but what you can overdo
the thing. I knew a man who was always coming home&mdash;seemed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
as if he couldn't stop away. I don't know
that <i>his</i> people were particularly glad to see him."</p>

<p>"How was that?"</p>

<p>"A bit tired of it, I suppose. You see, they'd given
him about nine distinct starts in life. They were always
shipping him off to foreign parts, with his passage
paid and a nice little bit of capital waiting for him
on the other side. And, if you'll believe me, every
blessed time he turned up again, if not by the next
steamer, by the next after that."</p>

<p>"What became of the capital?"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>that</i> he liquidated. Drank it&mdash;see? We've
all got our own particular little foibles, and my friend's
was drink."</p>

<p>"I don't wish to appear prejudiced, but I think I
should be inclined myself to call it a sin."</p>

<p>"You may <i>call</i> it a sin. It was the only one he'd got,
of any considerable size. I suppose you'd distinguish
between a sin and its consequences?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly," replied the clergyman unguardedly.</p>

<p>"Well. Then&mdash;there were the women&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Steady, my friend, that makes two sins."</p>

<p>"No. You can't count it as two. You see, he never
spoke to a girl till he was so blind drunk he couldn't
tell whether she was pretty or ugly. Women were a
consequence."</p>

<p>"That only made his sin the greater, sir."</p>

<p>"Ye&mdash;es. I reckon it did swell it up some. I said it
was a big one. Still, it's not fair to him to count it as
more than one. But then, what with gambling and
putting a bit on here, and backing a friend's bill there,
he managed to make it do duty for half a dozen. He
seemed to turn everything naturally to drink. You
may say he drank his widowed mother's savings, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
his father's life insurance; and, when that was done,
he pegged away at his eldest sister's marriage portion
and the money that should have gone for his younger
sister's education. Altogether he reduced 'em pretty
considerably. Besides all that, he had the cussedest
luck of any beggar I know.</p>

<p>"Not that he cared for his luck, as long as he got
enough to drink. But he wore his friends out. At last
they said they'd get up a subscription and pay his
passage out to the States, if he'd swear never to show
his ugly face in England again. Or at least not till
he knew how to behave himself, which was safe enough,
and came to the same thing, seeing that they didn't
believe he'd ever learn. He didn't believe it himself,
and would have sworn to anything. So they scraped
together ten pounds for his passage, intermediate. He
went steerage and drank the difference. They'd sent
on five pounds capital to start him when he landed,
and thought themselves very clever. The first thing
he did was to collar that capital and drink it too. Then
he went and worked in the store where he'd bought the
drink, for the sake of being near it&mdash;he loved it so.
Then&mdash;this is the queer part of the story&mdash;something
happened. I won't tell you what it was. It happened
because it was the worst thing that could have happened&mdash;it
was bound to happen, owing to his luck.
Whatever it was it made him chuck drinking. He left
the store where the stuff was, and applied for a berth
in a big business in Chicago. It was a place where
they didn't know him, else he wouldn't have got it.</p>

<p>"Then his luck turned. If it wasn't the same luck.
Just because he hadn't an object in life now&mdash;didn't
care about drinking any longer, nor yet about women,
because of the thing that had happened, and so hadn't
got any reasonable sort of use for money&mdash;he began
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
to make it. That's the secret of success, that is. Because
he didn't care what he called a tinker's cuss about
being foreman he was made foreman&mdash;then, for the
same reason, manager. Then he got sort of interested
in seeing the money come in. He didn't want it himself,
but it struck him that it wouldn't be a bad thing
to pay back his mother and his sisters what they'd
lost on him, besides making up for any little extra
trouble and expense he might have been to them. He
began putting dollars by just for that.</p>

<p>"I suppose you think that when he'd raked together
enough dollars he sent them home straightaway? Not
he. He wasn't such a blamed idiot. He knew it was
no manner of good being in a hurry if you wanted to
do a thing in style. He pouched those dollars himself
and bought a small share in the business. He bought
it for <i>them</i>, mind you. You'd have thought, now he
was interested and had got back a sort of object in life,
that his luck would have turned again, just to spite
him. But it didn't. He rose and he rose, and after a
bit they made him a partner. They had the capital,
and he had the brain. He'd found out that he'd more
brain than he knew what to do with. Regular nuisance
it was&mdash;so beastly active. Used to keep him
awake at night, thinking, when he didn't want to.
However, it dried up and let him alone once he gave it
the business to play with. At last the old partners
dropped off the concern&mdash;gorged; and he stuck to it.
By that time he had fairly got his hand in; and the
last year it was just a sitting still and watching the
long Atlantic roll of the dollars as they came tumbling
in. He stuck till he'd piled them up behind him, a
solid cold five million. And now he's ramping on the
home-path as hard as he can tear. The funny thing
is that his people are as poor as church mice&mdash;three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
brown mice in a fusty little house like a family pew.
But that's the house he's going to. And that five million's
just as much theirs as it is his, and perhaps a
little more."</p>

<p>"Ah," said his fellow-passenger, "that's pretty. That
sort of thing doesn't often happen outside a fairy
tale."</p>

<p>"No," said Stephen Lepper simply, "but he made it
happen."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Well? Do you think they'll be <i>sorry</i> to see him?
I don't mean because of the dollars&mdash;they won't care
about them."</p>

<p>"Of course they won't. My dear sir, it's fine&mdash;that
story of yours. It's the Prodigal Son&mdash;with a difference."</p>

<p>"A difference? I believe you!"</p>

<p>At this point Stephen Lepper was struck with a
humorous idea. It struck him on the back, as it were,
in such a startling manner that he forgot all about the
veil he had woven so industriously. (His companion,
indeed, judged that he had adopted that subterfuge
less as a concealment for his sins than as a decent covering
for his virtues.)</p>

<p>"That prodigal knew what to do with his herd of
swine, anyhow. He killed and cured 'em. And I
reckon he'll order his own fatted calf&mdash;and pay for it."</p>

<p>He stood revealed.</p>

<p>The clergyman got down at Rugby. In parting he
shook Mr. Stephen K. Lepper by the hand and wished
him&mdash;for himself a happy home-coming, for his friend
a good appetite for the fatted calf.</p>

<p>His hand was gripped hard, so that he suffered torture
till the guard slammed to the door of the compartment
and separated them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Lepper thrust his head out of the window. "No
fear!" he shouted.</p>

<p>The clergyman looked back once as the train moved
out of the station. The head was there, uncovered,
but still shouting.</p>

<p>"No durned&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He saw the gray hat waved wildly, but the voice was
ravished from him by the wind of the train.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>The train reached Little Sutton at seven. Just as he
had traveled third-class, so he had preposterously
planned to send his luggage on by carrier, and plod
the five miles between town and station on foot. He
wanted to keep up the illusion.</p>

<p>The station, anyhow, was all right. They had enlarged
it a bit, but it was still painted a dirty drab
(perhaps there used to be a shade more yellow ochre
in the drab), and the Virginian creeper still climbed
over the station master's box, veiling him as in a bower.
If he could have swallowed up time (fifteen years of
it) as the New York and Chicago Express swallowed
up space, he might have felt himself a young man
again, a limp young man, slightly the worse for drink,
handed down to the porter like a portmanteau by the
friendly arm of a fellow-passenger, on one of those
swift, sudden, and ill-timed returns that preceded his
last great exodus. Only that, whereas Stephen Lepper
at thirty-nine was immaculately attired, the coat of
that unfortunate young man hung by a thread or two,
and his trousers by a button; while, instead of five
million dollars piled at his back, he had but eighteenpence
(mostly copper) lying loose in his front pockets.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
But Stephen Lepper had grown so used to his clothes
and his millions that he carried them unconsciously.
They offered no violence to the illusion. What might
have destroyed it was the strange, unharmonizing fact
that he was sober. But he had got used to being sober,
too.</p>

<p>The road unrolled itself for two miles over the pale
green downs. It topped the spine of a little hog-backed
hill and dipped toward the town (road all right). To
his left, on the crest of the hill, stood the old landmark,
three black elms in a field that was rased and bleached
after the hay-harvest. They leaned toward each other,
and between their trunks the thick blue-gray sky
showed solid as paint (landmark all right).</p>

<p>In the queer deep light that was not quite twilight
things were immobile and distinct, as if emphasizing
their outlines before losing them. The illusion was
acute, almost intolerable.</p>

<p>Down there lay the town, literally buried in the
wooded combe. Slabs of gray wall and purple roof,
sunk in the black-green like graves in grass. A white
house here and there faced him with the stare of
monumental marble. In the middle a church with a stunted
spire squatted like a mortuary chapel. They had run
up a gaudy red-brick villa or two outside, but on the
whole Little Sutton was all right, too. He had always
thought it very like a cemetery&mdash;a place where people
lay buried till the Day of Judgment.</p>

<p>The man he had been was really dead and buried
down there. It was as if a glorified Stephen Lepper
stood up and contemplated his last resting-place. The
clothes he wore were so many signs and symbols of his
joyful resurrection. If any doubted, he could point to
them in proof. Not that he anticipated this necessity.
To be sure, his people had once regarded the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
possibility of a resurrection as, to say the least of it,
antecedently improbable. They had even refused to
accept his authentic letters, written on the actual paper
of a temperance hotel, as sufficient proof of it. He
had not altogether blamed them for their Sadducean
attitude, being a little skeptical himself.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the resurrection was an accomplished
fact. There had been a woman in it. She was to have
been his wife if she had lived. But she had not lived,
and her death was the one episode as to which he had
been reticent. She was the sort of woman that drives
men to drink by marrying them; for she had a face like
an angel and a tongue like a two-edged sword, sheathed
in time of courtship. The miracle had happened so
long ago that it had passed into the region of things
unregarded because admitting of no doubt. He had
never been what you might call a confirmed drunkard&mdash;he
hadn't been steady enough for that&mdash;and fifteen
years of incontrovertible sobriety had effaced the fitful
record of his orgies. So it never occurred to him now
that his character could be regarded otherwise than
with the confidence accorded to such solid and old-established
structures as the Church or Bank. He
dreaded no shrinking in the eyes of the three women
he had come to see. But supposing&mdash;merely supposing&mdash;anything
so unlikely as a mental reservation or
suspension of judgment on their part, there was that
solid pile of dollars at his back for proof. And because
the better part of five million dollars cannot be produced
visibly and bodily at a moment's notice, and because
the female mind has difficulty in grasping so
abstract an idea as capital, he had brought with him
one or two little presents&mdash;tangible intimations, as it
were, of its existence.</p>

<p>He had had two hours to spare at Liverpool before his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
train left Lime Street. They had flown in the rapture
of his shopping. To follow his progress through Castle
Street and Bond Street, the casual observer would have
deemed him possessed by a blind and maniac lust of
miscellaneous spending. But there had been method
in that madness, a method simple and direct. He had
stalked first of all into a great silk-mercer's and demanded
a silk suitable for an old lady, a satin suitable
for a young lady, another satin for a lady&mdash;not so
young. Then, suddenly remembering that his mother
used to yearn even in widowhood for plum color,
while Minnie (who was pretty and had red hair)
fancied a moss-green, and Kate (who was not pretty)
a rose-pink, he neither paused nor rested till he had
obtained these tints. Lace, too&mdash;his mother had had
a perfect passion for lace, unsatisfied because of its
ideal nature&mdash;a lace of her dreams. He had decided
on one or two fine specimens of old point. He supposed
this would be the nearest approach to the ideal, being
the most expensive. Then he had to get a few diamond
pins, butterflies, true-love knots, and so on, to fix it
with. And, while he was about it, a diamond necklace,
and a few little trifles of that sort for Minnie and
Kate. Then their figures (dimly dowdy) had come
back to him across the years, one plain, the other
pretty but peculiar. He accounted for that by remembering
that Kate had been literary, while Minnie was
musical.</p>

<p>So he had just turned in at a bookseller's and stated
that he wanted some books&mdash;say about twenty or
thirty pounds' worth. The man of books had gauged
his literary capacity in a glance, and suggested that he
had better purchase the Hundred Best Books. "Well,"
he had said (rather sharply, for time was getting on),
"I reckon I don't want any but the best." In the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
spirit he had approached the gentleman in the piano-forte
emporium and ordered a Steinway Grand to be
forwarded when he knew his permanent address. For
as yet it was uncertain which county contained it, that
princely residence&mdash;the old manor-house or baronial
hall&mdash;in which henceforth they would live together in
affluence. He didn't exactly see them there, those
three queer, dowdy little women. God forgive him, it
was his fault if they went shabby. He remembered
how they used to stint themselves, eating coarse food
and keeping no servant, so that Kate had never any
time for her books nor Minnie for her music. He
would change all that now.</p>

<p>As he walked on he dreamed a dream.</p>

<p>In the foreground of his dream (rich parqueterie)
three figures went to and fro, one adorable in plum
color and point lace; one, the one with the red hair,
still beautiful in green; and one, not beautiful, but&mdash;well&mdash;elegant
in pink. Now he saw a dining-room
sumptuously furnished, a table white with silver and
fine linen, and the same figures sitting at it, drinking
champagne and eating the fool messes that women love
to eat, queer things cooked in cream, and ice-puddings,
and so on. And now it was a lofty music room, and
Minnie taking the roof off with one of her So-nahters
on the Steinway Grand; and now a library (the Hundred
Best Books had grown into a library), and Kate,
studious, virgin, inviolate in leisure. Then slap
through it all went the little mother driving in her
own carriage, a victoria for fine weather, a brougham
for wet. (It was before the days of motor-cars.)
Somewhere on the outskirts of his dream (moorland
for choice) there hovered a gentleman in shooting
clothes, carrying a gun, or on the uttermost dim verge,
the sky-line of it, the same vague form (equestrian)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
shot gloriously by. But he took very little interest in
him.</p>

<p>Ah, there were the cross-roads and the Bald-faced
Stag at the corner. Not a scrap changed since the last
time he visited it&mdash;day when he rode the Major's
roan mare slap through the saloon bar into the bowling-alley.
Did it for a bet, and won it, too, and bought
his mother a stuffed badger in a glass case with the
money, as a propitiatory offering. Only another mile.</p>

<p>His road ran into the lighted High Street, through
a black avenue of elms as through a tunnel. Reality
assailed him with a thousand smells. No need to ask
his way to the North End.</p>

<p>He turned off through an alley into a dark lane,
bordered with limes. The thick, sweet scent dropped
from the trees, a scent dewy with the childhood of the
night. It felt palpable as a touch. It was as if he felt
his mother's fingers on his face, and the kisses of his
innocent girl-sisters.</p>

<p>He went slowly up the lane toward a low light at
the end of it. At the corner, where it turned, was a
small house black with ivy and fenced with a row of
espalier limes. The light he made for came from the
farthest window of the ground floor. Through a gap
in the lime fence he could see into the room.</p>

<p>The house was sunk a little below the level of the
lane, so that he seemed to be looking straight down
into a pit of yellow light hollowed out of the blackness.
Two figures sat knitting at the window on the
edge of the pit. His mother and Kate. A third, in
the center of the light, leaned her elbows on the table
and propped her head on her hands. He knew her for
Minnie by her red hair. Beyond them a side window
was open to the night.</p>

<p>There were two ways by which he could approach
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
them. He could go boldly in at the iron gate and up
the flagged path to the front door. Or he could go
round to the side, up the turning of the lane, where
the garden wall rose high, into the back garden.
Thence, through a thick yew arch into a narrow path
between the end of the house and the high wall. By
the one way they would be certain to see him through
the front window. By the other he would see them
(through the side window) without being seen. Owing
to a certain moisture and redness about his eyes
and nose he was not yet quite ready to be seen. Therefore
he chose the side way. Sitting on a garden seat
in the embrasure of the arch, he commanded a slanting
but uninterrupted view of the room and its inmates.</p>

<p>There, in the quiet, he could hear the clicking needles
of the knitters, and the breathing of the red-haired
woman. And he longed with a great longing for the
sound of their voices. If one of them would only
speak!</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>"The question is"&mdash;it was the red-haired girl who
spoke, and her tone suggested that the silence marked
a lull in some debate&mdash;"how much do you mean to advance
me this year from the housekeeping?"</p>

<p>The younger of the two knitters answered without
looking up.</p>

<p>"I've told you before; it depends upon circumstances."</p>

<p>"I see no circumstances."</p>

<p>"Don't you? I thought it was you who were so
sure about Stephen's coming home?"</p>

<p>"That makes no difference. If he doesn't come I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
shall go away. If he does I shall go away and stay
away. In that case I shall want more money, shan't
I? not less." Minnie dug her sharp elbows into the
table and thrust out her chin.</p>

<p>"You'll have to want," said Kate. "You know perfectly
well that if he is here none of us can go away.
We must keep together."</p>

<p>"Why must we?"</p>

<p>"Because it's cheaper."</p>

<p>"And suppose I choose to go? What's to keep me?"</p>

<p>"To <i>keep</i> you?"</p>

<p>"I see. You mean there won't be a penny to keep
me?"</p>

<p>Kate was silent.</p>

<p>"If it hadn't been for Stephen I could have kept myself
long ago&mdash;by my music. That's what I wanted."</p>

<p>"Well, you didn't get what you wanted. Women
seldom do."</p>

<p>"I want to go to the Tanquerays. There's no reason
why I shouldn't get that."</p>

<p>"You can't go to the Tanquerays as you are."</p>

<p>Minnie gazed at her clothes, then at her reflection
in the opposite looking-glass.</p>

<p>She wore a shabby, low-necked gown of some bluish-green
stuff, with a collar of coarse lace; also a string
of iridescent shells. Under the flame of her hair her
prettiness showed haggard and forlorn.</p>

<p>"Yes, you may well look at yourself. You must
have new things if you go. That means breaking into
five pounds."</p>

<p>Minnie's eyes were still fixed on the face in the looking-glass.</p>

<p>"It would be worth it," said she.</p>

<p>"It might be if you stopped five months. Not
unless."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>"Look here, Kate. It's all very well, but I consider
that the house owes me that five pounds. Mayn't I
have it, Stephen or no Stephen?"</p>

<p>"It's no use asking me now. It will depend on
Stephen."</p>

<p>"And Stephen, I imagine, will depend on us."</p>

<p>"Probably. Do you hear what Minnie says,
Mother?"</p>

<p>The old woman's hands knitted fiercely, while her
sharp yellow face crumpled into an expression half
peevish, half resigned.</p>

<p>"I hear what you both say, and I think I've got
enough to worry me without you talking about Stephen
coming home."</p>

<p>Her voice was so thin that even Minnie, not hearing,
had missed the point. As for the man outside, he was
still struggling with emotion, and had caught but a
word here and there.</p>

<p>Kate's voice was jagged like a saw and carried
farther. It was now that he really began to hear.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose he's made any money out there?"</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear of Stephen making money anywhere?"</p>

<p>"If he has he ought to be made to pay something
to the housekeeping. It's only fair."</p>

<p>"If he's made anything," said Minnie, "he's spent it
all. That's why he's coming. Look at the supper!"</p>

<p>The table before her was laid for the evening meal.
She pointed to the heels of two loaves, a knuckle of
ham, a piece of cheese, and some water in a glass jug.
Oatmeal simmered on a reeking oil-stove in a corner
of the room.</p>

<p>"How much will it cost to keep him?"</p>

<p>Kate's narrow, peaked face was raised in calculation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
Kate's eyes became mean homes for meaner thoughts
of which she was visibly unashamed.</p>

<p>"Ten shillings a week at the very least. Fifty-two
weeks&mdash;that's twenty-six pounds a year. Or probably
fifteen shillings&mdash;a man eats more than a woman, at
any rate more butcher's meat&mdash;that's thirty-nine
pounds. That's only what he <i>eats</i>," she added significantly.
"<i>What</i> did you say, Mother?"</p>

<p>The old lady raised her voice, and the man outside
took hope. "I say I think you're both very unfeeling.
For all you know, poor fellow, he may be quite reformed."</p>

<p>"He may be. I know the chances are he won't,"
said Kate.</p>

<p>"How do you know anything about it, my dear?"</p>

<p>"I asked Dr. Minify. He has a wide enough experience
of these cases."</p>

<p>Minnie turned fiercely round. "And what made
you go and blab to him about it? I think you might
wash your dirty linen at home."</p>

<p>"It's only what you'd have done yourself."</p>

<p>"Not to him."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>There was terror in Minnie's face. "He knows the
Tanquerays."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;it's your own fault. You went on about it
till it got on my nerves, and the anxiety was more
than I could bear. The porridge will be boiling over."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Well, I can't mind porridge and my knitting at the
same time."</p>

<p>Minnie threw herself back, pushing her chair with
her feet. She rose and trailed sulkily across to the
stove. As she moved a wisp of red hair, loosened from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
its coil, clung to her sallow neck. She was slip-shod
and untidy.</p>

<p>She removed the porridge abstractedly. "What did
he say?" she asked.</p>

<p>"He was extremely kind and sympathetic. He
treated it as a disease. He said that in nine cases out
of ten recovery is impossible."</p>

<p>"Well, <i>I</i> could have told you that. Anything more?"</p>

<p>"He says the chances are that he won't hold out
much longer; his health must have broken up after all
these years. I don't know how I <i>can</i> stand it, if it is.
When I think of all the things that may happen.
Paralysis perhaps, or epilepsy&mdash;that's far more likely.
He's just the age."</p>

<p>"Is he? How awful! But, then, he'll have to go
somewhere. You know we can't have him epilepsing
all over the place here."</p>

<p>The old lady dropped her knitting to raise her hands.</p>

<p>"Minnie! Minnie! Have a little Trust. He may
never come at all."</p>

<p>"He will. Trust <i>him</i>."</p>

<p>"After all," said Kate reflectively, "why should he?"</p>

<p>"Why? Why?" The girl came forward, spreading
her large red hands before her. "Because we've paid
all his debts. Because we've saved money and got
straight again. Because we're getting to know one or
two decent people, and it's taken us fifteen years to
do it. Because we're beginning to enjoy ourselves for
the first time in all our miserable lives. Because I've
set my heart on staying with the Tanquerays, and
Fred Tanqueray will be there. Because"&mdash;a queer,
fierce light came into her eyes&mdash;"because I'm happy,
and he means to spoil it all, as he spoilt it all before!
As if I hadn't suffered enough."</p>

<p>"You? What have you suffered?" Kate's sharp
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
face was red as she bent over a dropped stitch. Her
hands trembled. "You were too young to feel anything."</p>

<p>"I wasn't too young to feel that I had a career before
me, nor to care when it was knocked on the head.
If it hadn't been for him my music wouldn't have
come to an end as it did."</p>

<p>"Your music! If it hadn't been for him my engagement
wouldn't have been broken off&mdash;as it was."</p>

<p>"Oh <i>that</i>? It was the one solitary good day's work
Stephen ever did."</p>

<p>The old lady nodded shrewdly over her needles.
"Yes, my dear, you might be thankful for that mercy.
You couldn't have married Mr. Hooper. I'm afraid
he wasn't altogether what he ought to be. You yourself
suspected that he drank."</p>

<p>"Like a fish," interposed Minnie.</p>

<p>"I know"&mdash;Kate's hands were fumbling violently
over her stitch&mdash;"but&mdash;but I could have reclaimed
him."</p>

<p>Her eyes lost their meanness with the little momentary
light of illusion.</p>

<p>Minnie laughed aloud. "If that's all you wanted,
why didn't you try your hand on Stephen?"</p>

<p>"Don't, Minnie."</p>

<p>But Minnie did. "Fred Tanqueray doesn't drink;
I wouldn't look at him if he did. What's more, he's
a gentleman; I couldn't stand him if he wasn't. Catch
him marrying into this family when he's seen Stephen."</p>

<p>"Minnie, you are <i>too</i> dreadful."</p>

<p>"Dreadful? You'd be dreadful if you'd cared as
much for Charlie Hooper as I do for Fred Tanqueray."</p>

<p>"And how much does Mr. Tanqueray care for you?"</p>

<p>A dull flush spread over Minnie's sallow face; her
lips coarsened. "I don't know; but it's a good deal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
more than your Hooper man ever cared for anybody in
his life; and if you weren't such a hopeless sentimentalist
you'd have seen that much. Of course I
shan't know whether he cares or not&mdash;now."</p>

<p>And she wept, because of the anguish of her thirty
years.</p>

<p>Then she burst out: "I <i>hate</i> Stephen. I don't care
what you say&mdash;if he comes into this house I'll walk
out of it. Oh, how I hate him!" Her loose mouth
dropped, still quivering with its speech. Her face was
one flame with her hair.</p>

<p>But Kate was cool and collected.</p>

<p>"Don't excite yourself. If it's only to influence
Fred Tanqueray, he won't come," said Kate.</p>

<p>Then the red-haired woman turned on her, mad with
the torture of her frustrate passion.</p>

<p>"He <i>will</i> come! He <i>will</i> come, I tell you. I've felt
him coming. I've felt it in my bones. I've dreamt
about it night after night. I've been afraid to meet
the postman lest he should bring another letter. I've
been afraid to go along the station road lest I should
meet <i>him</i>. I'm afraid now to look out of that window
lest I should see him standing there with his face
against the pane."</p>

<p>She crossed to the window and drew down the blind.
For a moment her shadow was flung across it, monstrously
agitated, the huge hands working.</p>

<p>The man outside saw nothing more, but he heard
his mother's voice and he took hope again.</p>

<p>"For shame, Minnie, for shame, to speak of poor
Steevy so. One would think you might have a little
more affection for your only brother."</p>

<p>"Look here, Mother" (Minnie again!), "that's all
sentimental humbug. Can you look me in the face
and honestly say you'd be glad to see your only son?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>(The son's heart yearned, straining for the answer.
It came quavering.)</p>

<p>"My dear, I shall not see him. I'm a poor, weak
old woman, and I know that the Lord will not send me
any burden that I cannot bear."</p>

<p>He crept from his hiding-place out into the silent
lane. He had drawn his breath tight, but his chest still
shook with the sob he had strangled. "My God!" he
muttered, "I'll take off the burden."</p>

<p>Then his sob broke out again, and it sounded more
like a laugh than a sob. "The dollars&mdash;they shall have
them. Every blessed one of the damned five million!"</p>

<p>He looked at his watch by the light of the gas-lamp
in the lane. He had just time to catch the last train
down; time, too, to stop the carrier's cart with the
gifts that would have told the tale of his returning.</p>

<p>So, with a quick step, he went back by the way he
had come, out of the place where the dead had buried
their dead&mdash;until the Day of Judgment.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>He had not been near her for two months. It was
barely five minutes' walk from his house in Bedford
Square to her rooms in Montagu Street, and last year
he used to go to see her every week. He did not need
the reminder of her letter, for he had been acutely
aware, through the term that separated them, of the
date when he had last seen her. Still, he was not sure
how much longer he might have kept away if it had
not been for the note that told him in two lines that
she had been ill, and that she had&mdash;at last&mdash;something
to show him. He smiled at the childlike secrecy of
the announcement. She had something to show him.
Her illness, then, had not impaired her gift, her charming,
inimitable gift.</p>

<p>If she had something to show him he would have to
go to her.</p>

<p>He let his eyes rest a moment on her signature as if
he saw it for the first time, as if it renewed for him the
pleasing impression of her personality. After all, she
was Freda Farrar, the only woman with a style and an
imagination worth considering; and he&mdash;well, he was
Wilton Caldecott.</p>

<p>He would go over and see her now. He had an hour
to spare before dinner. It was her hour, between the
lamplight and the clear April day, when he was always
sure of finding her at home.</p>

<p>He found her sitting in her deep chair by the hearth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
her long, slender back bent forward to the fire, her
hands glowing like thin vessels for the flame. Her face
was turned toward him as he came in. Its small childlike
oval showed sharp and white under her heavy
wreath of hair&mdash;the face of a delicate Virgin of the
Annunciation, a Musa Dolorosa, a terrified dryad of
the plane-trees (Freda's face had always inspired him
with fantastic images); a dryad in exile, banished with
her plane-tree to the undelightful town.</p>

<p>She did not conceal from him her joyous certainty
that he would come. She made no comment on his absence.
It was one of her many agreeable qualities that
she never made comments, never put forth even the
shyest and most shadowy claim. She took him up
where she had left him, or, rather, where he had left
her, and he gathered that she had filled the interval
happily enough with the practice of her incomparable
art.</p>

<p>The first thing she did now was to exhibit her latest
acquisitions, her beautiful new reading-lamp, the two
preposterous cushions that supported and obliterated
her; while he saw (preposterous Freda, who had not a
shilling beyond what the gift brought her) that she
had on a new gown.</p>

<p>"I say," he exclaimed, "I say, what next?"</p>

<p>And they looked at each other and laughed. He
liked the spirit in which Freda now launched out into
the strange ocean of expenditure. It showed how he
had helped her. He was the only influence which could
have helped a talent so obscure, so uncertain, so shy.</p>

<p>It was the obscurity, the uncertainty, the shyness
of it that charmed him most. It was the shyness, the
uncertainty, the obscurity in her that held him, made
it difficult to remove himself when he sank into that
deep chair by her fireside, and she became silent and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
turned from him her small brooding face. It was as
if she guarded obstinately her secret, as if he waited,
was compelled to wait, for the illuminating hour.</p>

<p>"It's finished," she said, as if continuing some conversation
they had had yesterday.</p>

<p>"Ah." He found himself returning reluctantly from
his quest.</p>

<p>She rose and unlocked the cabinet where her slender
sheaves were garnered. He came and took from her a
sheaf more slender than the rest.</p>

<p>"Am I to read it, here and now?"</p>

<p>"If you will."</p>

<p>He sat down and read there and then. From time
to time she let her eyes light on him, shyly at first,
then rest, made quiet by his abstraction. She liked
to look at him when he was not thinking of her. He
was tall and straight and fair; his massive, clean-shaven
face showed a virile ashen shade on lip and chin.
He had keen, kind eyes, and a queer mouth with sweet
curves and bitter corners.</p>

<p>He folded the manuscript and turned it in his hands.
He looked from it to her with considering, caressing
eyes. What she had written was a love-poem in the
divinest, the simplest prose. Such a poem could only
have been written by his listening virgin, his dreaming
dryad. He was afraid to speak of it, to handle its
frail, half-elemental, half-spiritual form.</p>

<p>"Has it justified my sending for you?"</p>

<p>It had. It justified her completely. It justified them
both. It justified his having come to her, his remaining
with her, dining with her, if indeed they did dine. She
had always justified him, made his coming to see her
the natural, inevitable thing.</p>

<p>They sat late over the fire. They had locked the
manuscript in its drawer again, left it with relief.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>They talked.</p>

<p>"How many years is it since I first saw you?"</p>

<p>"Three years," she said, "and two months."</p>

<p>"And two months. Do you remember how I found
you, up there, under the roof, in that house in Charlotte
Street?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "I remember."</p>

<p>"You were curled up on that funny couch in the
corner, with your back against the wall&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I was sitting on my feet to keep them warm."</p>

<p>"I know. And you wore a white shawl&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," she entreated, "not a shawl."</p>

<p>"A white something. It doesn't matter. I don't
really remember anything but your small face, and
your terrified eyes looking at me out of the corner, and
your poor little cold hands."</p>

<p>She wondered, did he remember her shabby gown,
her fireless room, the queer couch that was her bed,
the hunger and the nakedness of her surroundings?</p>

<p>"You sat," she said, "on my trunk, the wooden one
with the nails on it. It must have been so uncomfortable."</p>

<p>He said nothing. Even now, when those things
were only a remembrance, the pity of them made him
dumb.</p>

<p>"And the next time you came," said she, "you made
a fire for me. Don't you remember?"</p>

<p>He remembered. He felt again that glow of self-congratulation
which warmed him whenever he considered
the comfort of her present state; or came into
her room and found her accumulating, piece by piece,
her innocent luxuries. Nobody but he had helped her.
It was disagreeable to him to think that another man
should have had a hand in it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet there would be others. He had already revealed
her to two or three.</p>

<p>"I wonder how you knew," she said.</p>

<p>"How I knew what?"</p>

<p>"That I was worth while."</p>

<p>He gave an inward start. She had made him suddenly
aware that in those days he had not known it.
He had had no idea what was in her. She had had
nothing then "to show" him.</p>

<p>It was as if she were asking him, as if he were asking
himself, what it was that had drawn him to her,
when, in the beginning, it wasn't and couldn't have
been the gift? Why had he followed her up when he
might so easily have dropped her? He had found her,
in the beginning, only because his old friend, Mrs.
Dysart, had written to him (from a distance that left
her personally irresponsible), and had asked him to
look for her, to discover what had become of her, to
see if there was anything that he could do. Mrs. Dysart
had intimated that she hardly thought anything
could be done; that there wasn't, you know, very much
in her&mdash;very much, that is to say, that would interest
Wilton Caldecott. They had been simply pitiful, the
girl's poor first efforts, the things that, when he had
screwed his courage to the point of asking for them,
were all she had to show him.</p>

<p>"I was too bad for words, you know," said she,
tracking his thought.</p>

<p>"You were. You were."</p>

<p>"There wasn't a gleam, a spark&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not one."</p>

<p>They laughed. The reminiscence of her "badness"
seemed to inspire them both with a secret exultation.
They drew together, uncovering, displaying to each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
other the cherished charm of it. Neither could say
why the thought of it was so pleasing.</p>

<p>"And look at you now," said Caldecott.</p>

<p>"Yes," she cried, "look at me now. What was it,
do you think, that made the difference?"</p>

<p>That he had never really known.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I suppose you're stronger, you know; and
things are different."</p>

<p>"Things?" she repeated. Her lips parted and closed,
as if she had been about to say something, and recalled
it with a sharp indrawing of her breath.</p>

<p>"And so," she said presently, "you think that was
it?"</p>

<p>"It may have been. Anyhow, you mustn't go getting
ill."</p>

<p>"I don't think," she said, "there's any need. But
don't be frightened. It won't go away."</p>

<p>"What won't?"</p>

<p>"The gift."</p>

<p>They laughed again. It was their own name for it.</p>

<p>"I wasn't thinking of it. I was thinking of you."</p>

<p>"It's the same thing," said she. "No. It won't go.
It can't go. I've got it fast."</p>

<p>He rose. He looked down on her; he seemed to
hesitate, to consider.</p>

<p>"I wonder," he said, "if I might ask my friend, Miss
Nethersole, to call on you? She's Mrs. Dysart's niece."</p>

<p>She consented, and with a terse good night he left
her.</p>

<p>She, too, wondered and considered. She knew that
she would some day have to reckon with his life, with
the world that knew him, with the women whom he
knew.

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Freda and Miss Nethersole had met several times
before the remarkable conversation that made them
suddenly intimate.</p>

<p>That she would have, sooner or later, some remarkable
conversation with Miss Nethersole was an idea
that had dawned upon Freda from the first. But until
the hour struck for them their acquaintance had been
distant.</p>

<p>It had the fascination of deep distance. Freda had
not been sure that she desired to break the charm. It
seemed somehow to hold her safe. From what danger
she would have found it hard to say, when Miss Nethersole
covered her with so large and soft a wing. Still,
they had come no nearer to the friendship which the
older woman had offered as the end of their approaches.</p>

<p>It was as if Miss Nethersole were also bound under
the charm. When Freda allowed herself to meditate
profoundly she divined that what drew them on and
held them back was an uncertainty regarding Wilton
Caldecott. Neither knew in what place the other
really held him. The first day they met each had
searched, secretly, the other's face for some betrayal
of his whereabouts; each, it had seemed to Freda, had
shrunk from finding what she looked for; shrunk even
more from owning that there might be anything to find.</p>

<p>And he had hoped that she would "like Julia."</p>

<p>If reticence were required of them, Freda felt that
her poor little face could never rival the inimitable
reserves, the secure distinction of Miss Nethersole's.
There was nothing, so to speak, to take hold of in
Julia's dark, attenuated elegance; nothing that betrayed
itself anywhere, from the slender brilliance of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
her deep-lidded, silent eyes, to her small flat chin,
falling sheer from the immobile lower lip. Miss Nethersole's
features and her figure were worn away to the
last expression of a purely social intention. Quite useless
to look for any signs of Wilton Caldecott's occupation.
Freda was convinced that, if the lady possessed
any knowledge of him, she would keep it concealed
about her to the end of time. She was aware of Miss
Nethersole's significance as a woman of the larger
world. It was wonderful to think that she held the
clue to the social labyrinth, in which, to Freda's vision,
their friend's life was lost. She knew what ways he
went. She could follow all his turnings and windings
there; perhaps she could track him to the heart of the
maze; perhaps she herself was the heart of it, the very
secret heart. She sat alone for him there, in the dear
silent place where all the paths led. The very thickness
and elaboration of the maze would make their
peace. Freda's heart failed her before the intricacy of
Miss Nethersole's knowledge of him, the security of
her possession. Miss Nethersole was valuable to him
for her own sake, it being evident that she had no
"gift."</p>

<p>It was her personal sufficiency, unsustained as she
was by anything irrelevant, that made Julia so formidable.</p>

<p>She had never seemed more so to Freda than on this
afternoon when they sat together among the adornments
of her perfect drawing-room. Everything about
Miss Nethersole was as delicate and finished as her
own perfection. She was finely unconscious of all that
Freda recognized in her. It seemed as if what she
chiefly recognized in Freda was her gift. She had been
superbly impersonal in her praise of it. It was the
divine thing given to Freda, hers and yet not hers, so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
wonderful, compared with the small pale creature who
manipulated it, that it could be discussed with perfect
propriety apart from her.</p>

<p>And to-day Wilton Caldecott's name had risen again
in the discussion, when Julia had the air of insisting
more than ever on the gift. It was almost as if she
narrowed Freda down to that, suggesting that it was
the only thing that counted in her intimacy with their
friend.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Freda, "but the extraordinary thing is
that I hadn't it when first he knew me."</p>

<p>"He saw what was in you."</p>

<p>"He said the other day he saw nothing. I was too
bad for words."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know all about that. He told me."</p>

<p>"What did he tell you?"</p>

<p>"That you were like a funny little unfledged bird,
trying to fly before its wing feathers were grown."</p>

<p>"I hadn't any. I hadn't anything of my own.
Everything I have I owe to him."</p>

<p>"Don't say that. Why should you pluck off all your
beautiful feathers to make a nest for his conceit?"</p>

<p>"Is he conceited?"</p>

<p>Freda said to herself, "After all, she doesn't count.
She doesn't know him."</p>

<p>Miss Nethersole smiled. "He's a male man, my
dear. If you want him to have an even higher idea
of your genius than he has already, tell him&mdash;tell him
you owe it all to him."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Freda, "you don't know him."</p>

<p>"I have known him," said Miss Nethersole, "for
fifteen years. I knew him before he married."</p>

<p>She had proved incontestably the superiority of her
knowledge. Freda felt as if Miss Nethersole were
looking at her to see how she would take it. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
was an appreciable moment in which she adjusted
her mind to the suddenness of the revelation. Then
she told herself that there was nothing in it that she
had not reckoned with many times before. It left her
relations with Wilton Caldecott where they were.</p>

<p>There was nothing in it that could change for her
the unique and immaterial tie. She was even relieved
by the certainty that it was not Julia Nethersole, then,
after all. She had an idea that she would have grudged
him to Julia Nethersole.</p>

<p>Julia was much too well-bred to show that she had
the advantage. She took it for granted that Miss
Farrar was also acquainted with the circumstances
of Wilton Caldecott's marriage.</p>

<p>"That," said she, "is what makes him so extraordinarily
interesting."</p>

<p>"His marriage"&mdash;Freda hesitated. She wondered if
Miss Nethersole would really go into it.</p>

<p>"Some people's marriages are quite unilluminating.
Wilton's, I always think, is the key to his character,
sometimes to his conduct."</p>

<p>Freda held her breath. She saw that Miss Nethersole
was about to go in deep.</p>

<p>"He has suffered"&mdash;Miss Nethersole went on&mdash;"all
his life, from an over-developed sense of honor. He
could see honor in situations where you wouldn't have
said there was the ghost of an obligation. His marriage
was not an affair of the heart. It was an affair
of honor. The woman&mdash;she's dead now&mdash;was in love
with him."</p>

<p>"Did you know her?"</p>

<p>"No. She was not the sort of person you do know.
She was simply a pretty, underbred little governess.
He met her&mdash;on the staircase, I imagine&mdash;in some
house he was staying in, and, as I say, she was in love
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
with him. She was a scheming little wretch, and she
and her people made him believe that he had compromised
her in some shadowy way. I suppose he <i>had</i>
paid her a little ordinary attention&mdash;I don't know the
details. Anyhow, he was so fantastically honorable
that he married her."</p>

<p>"Poor thing. It must have been awful for her, to
be married in that way&mdash;for honor!"</p>

<p>"She didn't consider it awful in the least. She
didn't mind what she was married <i>for</i>, so long as she
<i>was</i> married. She was that sort. Do I bore you?"</p>

<p>"No. You interest me immensely."</p>

<p>"Of course they were miserable. He couldn't make
her happy. Wilton is, in his way, a rather spiritual
person, and his wife was anything but. Marriage can
be an awful revelation to a nice woman. Sometimes
it's a shock to a nice man. Wilton never got over <i>his</i>
shock. It left him with a morbid horror of the thing.
That's what has prevented him from marrying again."</p>

<p>Miss Nethersole drew a perceptible breath before
going in deeper.</p>

<p>"I've heard people praising his faithfulness to his
wife's memory. They little know. He was loyal
enough to the poor woman while she lived, but he's
giving her away now with a vengeance. Several very
nice women would have been more than willing to
marry him; but as soon as he knew it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Knew it? How could he know it?"</p>

<p>"Well, the ladies were very transparent, some of
them. And when they weren't there was always some
kind person there to make them so. And when he saw
through them&mdash;he was off. You could see the horror
of it coming over him, and his poor terrified eyes protesting&mdash;'I'd
do anything for you&mdash;anything, my dear
girl, but that.'"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>Julia paused, as if on the brink of something still
profounder. Evidently she abhorred the plunge, while
Freda shrank from the horrible exposure of the shallower
waters.</p>

<p>"And those women," said Julia, after meditation,
"wondered why they lost their friend. They might
have kept him if they'd only kept their heads."</p>

<p>It was at this point that Freda felt that Julia was
trying to drag her in with her.</p>

<p>"How awful," said she, "to feel that you'd driven
a man away!"</p>

<p>"It might be more awful," said Julia, "for him to feel
he had to go."</p>

<p>"That's it," said Freda. "<i>Had</i> he?"</p>

<p>"Well, if he was honorable, what else was there for
him to do?"</p>

<p>"To stay by those women, and see them through&mdash;if
he was honorable."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;if they'd have been content with that. But
you see, my dear, they all wanted to marry him."</p>

<p>"If they did," said Freda, "that shows that they
didn't really care."</p>

<p>"They cared too much, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"Oh, no. Not enough. If they'd cared enough
they'd have got beyond that. However much they
wanted it, they'd have given it up, rather than let him
go."</p>

<p>As she said it she felt a blessed sense of relief. The
deeper they went the more the waters covered her.</p>

<p>"You'll never get a man," said Julia, "to understand
that. If <i>he</i> cares for a woman he won't be put off with
anything short of marrying her. So he naturally supposes&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Julia had now gone as deep as she could go.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Freda. "It's in the things he naturally
supposes that a man goes so wrong."</p>

<p>"Is it?" Julia paused again. "I don't know whether
you realize it, but you and I are the only women Mr.
Caldecott ever goes to see. I dare say you were surprised
when he told you about me. I was amazed
when he told me about you. I've no doubt he made
each of us think we were the one exception. You see,
we are rather exceptional women, from his unhappy
point of view. He knows that I understand him, and
I'm sure he thinks that he understands you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So he feels safe with me?"</p>

<p>"Gloriously safe. <i>You</i> are a genius, above all the
little feminine stupidities that terrify him so. From
you he expects nothing but the unexpected. You're
outside all his rules. I'm so much inside them that he
knows exactly what to expect. So he's safe with both
of us. It's the betwixt-and-between people that he
dreads."</p>

<p>Julia rose up from the depths rosy and refreshed.
Freda panted with a horrible exhaustion.</p>

<p>"I see," she said. And presently she found that it
was time for her to go.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>The cool, bright air out of doors touched her like a
reminding hand. She turned awkwardly into the street
that led from Bedford Square to her own place. Wilton
Caldecott and she had often walked along that
street together. She felt like one called upon to play
a new part on a familiar stage, where every object
suggested insanely, irrelevantly, the older inspiration.</p>

<p>Not that her conversation with Julia, or, rather (she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
corrected herself) Julia's conversation with her, had
altered anything. It had all been so natural, so unamazing,
like a conversation between two persons in a
dream. They had both seemed so ripe for their hour
that, when it struck, it brought no sense of the unusual.
Only when she lit her lamp in her room, and received
the full shock of the old intimate reality, did it occur
to her that it was, after all, for Julia Nethersole, a
rather singular outpouring. The more she thought of
it the more startling it seemed&mdash;Julia's flinging off of
the reticence that had wrapped her round. Freda was
specially appalled by the audacity with which Julia
had dragged Wilton Caldecott's history into the light
of day. Her own mind had always approached it
shyly and tenderly, with a sort of feeling that, after
all, perhaps she would rather not know. To Freda
Julia seemed to have taken leave suddenly of her
senses, to have abandoned all propriety. One did, at
supreme moments, leave many things behind one; but
Freda was not aware that any moment in their intercourse
had yet counted as supreme.</p>

<p>Could Julia have meant anything by it? If so, what
was it that she precisely meant? The beginning of
their conversation provided no clue to its end. What
possible connection could there be between her, Freda's
gift, such as it was, and Wilton Caldecott's marriage?</p>

<p>But as she pieced together, painfully, the broken
threads she saw that it did somehow hang together.
She recalled that there had been something almost
ominous in the insistence with which Julia had held
her to her gift. Julia's manner had conveyed her disinclination
to acknowledge Wilton's part in it, her
refusal to regard him as indispensable in the case. She
had implied, with the utmost possible delicacy, that
it would be well for Freda if she could contrive to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
moderate her enthusiasm, to be a little less grateful;
to cultivate, in a word, her independence.</p>

<p>It was then that she had gone down into her depths.
And emerging, braced and bracing from the salt sea,
she had landed Freda safe on the high ledge, where she
was henceforth to stand solitary, guarding her gift.</p>

<p>It was, in short, a friendly warning to the younger
woman to keep her head if she wished to keep their
friend.</p>

<p>Freda remembered her first disgraceful fear of Julia,
her feeling that Julia would presently take something&mdash;she
hardly knew what&mdash;away from her. That came
of letting her imagination play too freely round Wilton
Caldecott's friend. What was there to alarm her in
the candid Julia? Wasn't it as if Julia, in their curious
conversation, had given herself up sublimely for Freda
to look at and see for herself that there was nothing
in her to be afraid of?</p>

<p>It was possible that Julia had seen things in <i>her</i>.
Freda had a little thrill of discomfort at that thought;
but she rallied from it bravely. What if Julia did see?
She was not aware of anything that she was anxious
to conceal from her. Least of all had she desired to
hide her part in Wilton Caldecott. It was, if you came
to think of it, the link between her and Julia, the
ground of their acquaintance. She could not suspect
Julia of any vulgar desire to take <i>that</i> away from her.</p>

<p>If there had been any lapse from high refinement it
had been in her own little cry of "Ah, you don't know
him," into which poor Freda now felt that she had
poured the very soul of passionate possession. But
Julia had been perfect. She had in effect said: "I
see&mdash;and you won't mind my seeing&mdash;that your friendship
for Wilton Caldecott is your dearest and purest
possession, as it's mine. I'm not ashamed to own it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
And I'll show you how to keep it. Take care of the
gift&mdash;the gift. It'll see you both through." Julia had
been fine. What else <i>could</i> she be? Of course she had
seen; and she had sacrificed her reticence beautifully,
because it was the only way. It was, said Freda to
herself, what <i>she</i> would have done if she had been in
Julia's place, and had seen.</p>

<p>Having reconstructed Julia, she unlocked the drawer
that held the hidden treasure, the thing that he had
said was so perfect, the last consummate manifestation
of the gift. They had found between them the right
word for it. It was only a gift, a thing that he had
given her, that if he chose he could at any moment
take away. What had come from her came only
through him. She owned, with a sort of exultation,
that there was nothing in the least creative in her.
She had not one virile quality; only this receptivity of
hers, infinitely plastic, infinitely tender. What lay in
the lamplight under her caressing hand had been born
of their friendship. It was their spiritual child.</p>

<p>She bowed her head and kissed it.</p>

<p>She said to herself: "It is not me, but his part in
me that he loves. If I am true to it he will be true to
me."</p>

<p>As she raised her head her eyes were wet with tears.
She looked round the room. Everything in it (but
the thing that lay there under her hand) seemed suddenly
to have lost its interest and its charm. Something
had gone from it, something that had been living
with her in secret for many days, that could not live
with her now any more. It had dropped into the deep
when Julia stripped herself (it now seemed to Freda)
and took her shining, sacrificial plunge.</p>

<p>"What, after all," said Freda, "has she taken from
me? Nothing that I ever really had."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>It was Sunday afternoon. Caldecott made a point
of going to see Miss Nethersole on Sunday afternoons.
He felt so safe with Julia.</p>

<p>This particular Sunday afternoon was their first
since Julia had become acquainted with Miss Farrar.
It was therefore inevitable that their talk should turn
to her.</p>

<p>"Your friend is charming," said Julia.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "yes." He seemed reluctant to
acknowledge it. Julia made a note of the reluctance.</p>

<p>"You must be very proud of her."</p>

<p>He challenged the assertion with a glance which
questioned her right to make it. Julia saw that his
mind was balancing itself on some fine and perilous
edge, and that it was as yet unaware of its peril.</p>

<p>"Of course you're proud of her," said she, in a voice
that steadied him.</p>

<p>"Of course I am," he agreed.</p>

<p>"Is it really true that she owes everything to you?"</p>

<p>"No," he said, "it isn't in the least true."</p>

<p>"She says so."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's her pretty way of putting it."</p>

<p>"She thinks it."</p>

<p>"Not she. If she does it's because she's made that
way. She's awfully nice, you know."</p>

<p>"She's too nice&mdash;to be allowed to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"To throw herself away."</p>

<p>"She isn't throwing herself away. She's found the
one thing she can do, and she's doing it divinely. I
never met a woman who was so sure of herself."</p>

<p>"Oh, she's sure enough, poor child."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>"I say, you don't mean to tell me you don't believe
in her? Not that it matters whether you do or not."</p>

<p>"Thank you. I'm not talking about her genius, or
whatever the thing is. I've no doubt it's everything
you say. If she'd only keep to that&mdash;the one thing
she <i>can</i> be sure of. Unless, of course, you've made her
sure."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Ah, if I only knew what <i>you</i> meant."</p>

<p>"What I mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes, what you mean to do."</p>

<p>He laughed. "I don't mean to 'do' anything at
present."</p>

<p>"Well, then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, what do you suppose I ought to do?"</p>

<p>"I don't know that it's for me to say."</p>

<p>"You may as well, while you're about it."</p>

<p>"If I could only make you see&mdash;&mdash;" She mentally
drew back.</p>

<p>"Well? What do you want to make me see?"</p>

<p>"What you've done already to that unhappy
woman."</p>

<p>"Unhappy? She's considerably happier than she
was when I first knew her."</p>

<p>"That's it," she said, "that's just it. Where are your
eyes? Can't you see she's in love with you?"</p>

<p>He did not meet her advancing gaze.</p>

<p>"What makes you think so?" he said.</p>

<p>"The way she talks about you."</p>

<p>He smiled. "You don't allow for picturesque exaggeration."</p>

<p>"My dear, when a woman exaggerates to that extent
it generally means one thing."</p>

<p>"Not with her. She wouldn't do it if it meant that.
She'd be afraid to let herself go. And she isn't afraid.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
She just piles it on because she's so sure of herself&mdash;so
sure that she isn't what you say she is."</p>

<p>"I don't say she knows she's in love with you. She
doesn't know it."</p>

<p>"Can you be in love without knowing it?"</p>

<p>"She could. If she knew it, do you think she'd have
let me see it? And do you think I'd have given her
away? I wouldn't now, only I know what you are, and
she doesn't."</p>

<p>"No, indeed. You're right enough there."</p>

<p>They paused on that.</p>

<p>"You're quite sure," she said, "that you can't&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was as if she probed him, delicately, on behalf of
their tragic friend. She turned her eyes away as she
did it, that she might not see him shrink.</p>

<p>"No," he said. "Never again. Never again."</p>

<p>She withdrew the pressure of the gentle finger that
had given him pain. "I only thought&mdash;" she murmured.</p>

<p>"What did you think?"</p>

<p>"That it might be nice for both of you."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be nice for either of us. Not nice at
all."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I can only see one thing."</p>

<p>"I know. You're going to say I must leave off seeing
her?"</p>

<p>"No. I don't say that."</p>

<p>"I do, though. If I were sure&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You may be sure of one thing. That she doesn't
know what's the matter with her&mdash;yet. She mustn't
know. If you do go and see her, you must be careful
not to let her find out. I did my best to hide it, to
cover it up, so that she shouldn't see."</p>

<p>"Your suspicion?"</p>

<p>"What do you think we're made of? The truth&mdash;the
truth."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>"If this is the truth, I mustn't, of course, go near her.
But I know you're mistaken."</p>

<p>"Have I ever been mistaken? Have I ever told you
wrong?"</p>

<p>"Well, Julia, you're a very wise woman, and I'll
admit that, when you've warned me off anybody,
you've warned me for my good."</p>

<p>She colored. "I'm not warning you 'off' anybody
now. I've warned you before for your own sake. I'm
warning you this time for hers."</p>

<p>"I see. I see that, all right. But&mdash;you never saw
a woman like her, did you? I wonder if you understand
her."</p>

<p>"I do understand her. You can't look at her and not
see that she has a profound capacity for suffering."</p>

<p>"I know."</p>

<p>Of course he knew. Hadn't he called her the Musa
Dolorosa?</p>

<p>"Just because," said Julia, "she has imagination."</p>

<p>He had said good-bye and was going; but at the
doorway he turned to her again.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "you're wrong, Julia. She's not like
that."</p>

<p>Julia arched her brows over eyes tender with compassion&mdash;compassion
for his infinite stupidity.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear!" she cried, and waved him away as
a creature hopeless, impossible to help.</p>

<p>He closed the door and stood with his back to it,
facing her.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "you may be right; but before I do
anything I must be sure."</p>

<p>"How do you propose to make sure?"</p>

<p>"I shall go and see her."</p>

<p>"Of course," said Julia, "you'll go and see her."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>He went on to Montagu Street, so convinced was he
that Julia was mistaken.</p>

<p>Freda knew well what she was going to say to him.
She had chosen her path, the highest, the farthest
from the abyss. Once there she could let herself go.</p>

<p>He himself led her there; he started her. He
brought praises of the gift.</p>

<p>Other people, he said, were beginning to rave about
it now.</p>

<p>"I wish they wouldn't," said she. "It makes me feel
so dishonest."</p>

<p>"Dishonest?"</p>

<p>"As if I'd taken something that didn't belong to me.
It doesn't belong to me."</p>

<p>"What doesn't?"</p>

<p>"It&mdash;the gift! I feel as if it had never had anything&mdash;really&mdash;to
do with me."</p>

<p>"Ah, that's the way to tell that you've got it."</p>

<p>"I know, but I don't mean that. I mean&mdash;it does
belong so very much to somebody else, that I ought
almost to give it back."</p>

<p>He had always wondered how she did it. Now for
one moment he believed that she was about to clear up
her little mystery. She was going to tell him that she
hadn't done it at all, that somebody else had borrowed
her name for some incomprehensible purpose of concealment.
She was going to make an end of Freda
Farrar.</p>

<p>"Of course," she said, "I know you don't want it
back."</p>

<p>"I?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes. It's really yours, you know. I should never
have had it at all if it hadn't been for you."</p>

<p>"I'm very glad," he said gravely, "if I've helped
you."</p>

<p>He was thinking, "She does really rather pile it on."</p>

<p>Freda went piling it on more. She felt continuously
that the gift would see them through. She would hold
it well before him, and turn it round and round, that
he might see for himself that there was nothing that
could be considered sinister behind it. Her passionate
concentration on it would show that there <i>was</i> nothing
behind, no vision of anything darker and deeper. It
was as if she said to him, "I know the dreadful thing
you're afraid of. I'm showing you what it is, so that
you needn't think it's that."</p>

<p>Not that she was afraid of his thinking it. She had
set her happiness high, in a pure serene place, safe
from the visitations of his terror. She conceived that
the peace of it might in time come to constitute a kind
of happiness for him. That gross fear could never
arise between him and her. All the same, she perceived
that a finer misgiving might menace his perfect
peace. He might, if he were subtle enough, imagine
that she was giving him too much, and that he owed
her something. His chivalry might become uneasy.
She must show him how perfectly satisfied she was.
He must see that the thing she had hold of was great,
was immense, that it filled her life to the brim, so that
there wasn't any room for anything else. How could
he owe her anything when he had given her that?</p>

<p>She must make him see it very clearly.</p>

<p>"It wasn't only that you <i>helped</i>," she said, "to bring
it out of me. It wasn't in me. When it came, it seemed
to come from somewhere outside. Somebody must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
have put it into me. I believe such a thing is possible.
And there wasn't anybody, you know, but you."</p>

<p>"I doubt," said he, "the possibility. Anyhow, you
may safely leave me out of it."</p>

<p>"Think," she said, "think of the time when you were
left out of it, when it was only me. It's inconceivable&mdash;the
difference&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let's leave it at that. Why rub the bloom off the
mystery?"</p>

<p>"Do I rub the bloom off?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you make out that I had anything to do
with it."</p>

<p>"If it's mystery you want, don't you see that's the
greatest mystery of all&mdash;your having had to do with
it?"</p>

<p>"But why should I, of all people? Is there any
sign of Freda Farrar in anything I did before I knew
her?"</p>

<p>"Is there any sign of her in anything she did before
she knew you?"</p>

<p>He was silent.</p>

<p>"Then," said Freda, "if it isn't you it's we. We've
collaborated."</p>

<p>If he had not been illumined by the horrid light Julia
had given him he would have said that this was only
Freda's way, another form of her adorable extravagance.
Now he wondered.</p>

<p>Poor Freda went on piling up her defenses. "Don't
you see?" said she. "That's why I feel so sure of it.
If it had been just me, I should never have been sure
a minute. It might have gone any day, and I should
have known that there was no more where it came
from. But, if it's you, I can simply lean back on it and
rest. Don't you see?"</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I don't see."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>(He was saying to himself: "I'm afraid Julia was
right about her. Only she doesn't know it.")</p>

<p>"You must leave me out of it. You mustn't let
yourself think that you rest on anything or anybody
but yourself."</p>

<p>It was what Julia had said, searching her with her
woman's eyes. He did not look at her as he said it.</p>

<p>Her nerves still shook under Julia's distant and delicate
admonition to her to keep her head. It struck her
that he was repeating the warning in a still more delicate
and distant manner. She wondered was it possible
that he was beginning to be afraid? Couldn't
he see that he was safe with her? That they were safe
with one another? What was she doing now but letting
him see how safe they were? Hadn't she just
given to their relations the last touch of spiritual completion?
She had made a place for him where he could
come and go at will, and rest without terror. Couldn't
he see that she had set her house of life above all that,
so high that nobody down here could see what went on
up there, and wonder at his going out and coming in?</p>

<p>Keep her head, indeed! Her untroubled and untrammeled
movements on her heights proved how
admirably she kept it.</p>

<p>"You see," he continued, "it's not as if I could be
always here, on the spot."</p>

<p>His voice still sounded the distant note of warning.
It told her that there was something that he wished to
make <i>her</i> see.</p>

<p>Her best answer to that was silence, and a sincere
front intimating that she saw everything, and that
there was nothing to touch her in the things <i>he</i> saw.</p>

<p>"And as it happens" (Caldecott's voice shook a
little), "I'm going away next week. I shall be away
a very long time."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>She knew that he did not look at her now lest he
should see her wince. She did not wince.</p>

<p>"Well," said she, "I shall be here when you come
back."</p>

<p>It was then that she saw the terror in his face.</p>

<p>"Of course," he said, "I hope&mdash;very much&mdash;you will
be here."</p>

<p>She felt that he, like Julia, was leading her to the
edge of the deep dividing place, and that he paused
miserably where Julia had plunged. She saw him trying
to bridge the gulf, to cover it, with decent, gentle
commonplaces and courtesies. Then he went away.</p>

<p>What had she done to make him afraid of her? Or
was it what she had said? The other day, before she
had seen Julia, she could have said anything to him.
Now it seemed there was nothing that she could say.</p>

<p>What was it that he had seen in her?</p>

<p>That was it. With all his wonderful comprehension
he had failed her in the ultimate test&mdash;the ability to
see what was in her. He had seen nothing but one
thing, the thing he was accustomed to see, the material
woman's passion to pursue, to make captive, to possess.
He would go thinking all his life that it was she
who had failed, she who, by her vulgarity, had made it
impossible for him to remain her friend. She supposed
she <i>had</i> piled it up too high. It was her very
defenses that had betrayed her, made her more flagrant
and exposed.</p>

<p>She bowed herself for hours to the scourging of that
thought till the thought itself perished from exhaustion.</p>

<p>She knew that it was not so. He held her higher
than that.</p>

<p>He was not afraid. He was only sorry for her. He
had tried to be more tender to her than she was herself.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
He was going away because his honor, his masculine
honor, told him that if he could not marry her
there was nothing else for him to do. He was trying
to spare her pain. It was very honorable of him, she
knew.</p>

<p>But it would have been more honorable still if he
had stayed; if he had trusted her to keep her friendship
incorruptible by pain. Or rather, if he had seen
that no pain could touch her, short of the consummate
spiritual torture he was inflicting now.</p>

<p>There were moments when she stood back from the
torture self-delivered. When she heard herself saying
to him: "I know why you're going. It's because you
think I wanted you to give me something that you can't
give me. Don't you see that if you can't give it me
it doesn't matter? It's, after all, so little compared
with what you have given me. Is it honorable to take
that away? Don't you see how you're breaking faith
with me? Don't you see that you've made me
ashamed, and that nothing can be worse to bear than
that?"</p>

<p>Then she knew that she would never be able to say
that to him. She would never be able to say anything
to him any more. She wondered whether he had made
those other women ashamed when he broke loose from
them. Was she ashamed, did she suffer, the woman
who had caught and held him, and hurt him so?</p>

<p>At the thought of his hurt her passion had such pity
that it cried out in her, "What have they done to you
that you can't see?"</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>He went away the following week to the North, and
remained there for six months. His honor prescribed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
a considerable term of absence. It compelled him to
keep away from her for some time after his return.
He told himself that she had the consolation of her
gift.</p>

<p>Meanwhile no sign of it had reached him since the
day he left her. Julia could give him no news of her;
she believed, but was not certain, that Freda was away.
When he called in Montagu Street he was told that
Miss Farrar had given up her rooms and gone abroad.</p>

<p>He wrote to the address given him, and heard from
her by return. She told him that she was very well;
that San Remo was very beautiful; that she was sure
he would be glad to hear that a small income had been
left to her, enough to relieve her from the necessity
of writing&mdash;she had not, in fact, written a line in the
last year&mdash;otherwise, of course, he would have heard
from her. "It rather looks," she added, "as if poverty
had been my inspiration."</p>

<p>In every word he read her desire to spare him.</p>

<p>It had not stayed with her, then? The slender flame
had died in her, the sudden spirit had fled. Well, if it
had to go, it was better that it should go this way, all
at once, rather than that they should have had to
acknowledge any falling-off from the delicate perfection
of her gift.</p>

<p>Three months later a letter from his friend, Mrs.
Dysart, informed him of Freda's death at San Remo
early in the spring.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dysart had seen her there. She was now staying
with her niece, Julia Nethersole, and desired to see
him. She was sure that he would want to hear about
their friend.</p>

<p>He remembered Mrs. Dysart as a small, robust, iron-gray
woman&mdash;sharp-tongued, warm-hearted, terrifically
observant. Though childless, she had always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
struck him as almost savagely maternal. He dreaded
the interview, for he had had some vague idea that she
had not appreciated Freda. Besides, his connection
with Miss Farrar was so public that Mrs. Dysart would
have no delicacy in approaching it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dysart proved more reticent than he had feared.
The full flow of her reminiscences began only under
pressure.</p>

<p>The news of Miss Farrar's death, she said, came to
her as a shock, but hardly as a surprise.</p>

<p>"You were not with her, then?" he said.</p>

<p>"No one was with her."</p>

<p>The words dropped into a terrible silence. A sound
broke it, the sound of some uneasy movement made by
Julia.</p>

<p>"When did you see her last?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I saw her last driving on the sea front at San Remo.
If you could call it seeing her. She was all huddled
up in furs and rugs and things. Just a sharp white
slip of a face and two eyes gazing at nothing out of the
carriage window. She looked as if something had
scared her."</p>

<p>And it was of her that he had been afraid!</p>

<p>"Do you know," he said presently, "what she died
of?"</p>

<p>"No. It was supposed that, some time or other, she
must have had some great shock."</p>

<p>Caldecott shifted his position.</p>

<p>"The doctors said there was no reason why she
should have died. She could have lived well enough
if she had wanted to. The terrible thing was that she
didn't want. If you ask me what she died of I should
say she was either scared to death or starved."</p>

<p>"Surely," he said, "surely she had enough?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she had food enough to eat, and clothes enough
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
to cover her, and fire enough to warm her. But she
starved."</p>

<p>"What do you suppose," said Julia, "the poor girl
wanted?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, my dear, that you would understand."</p>

<p>He was at a loss to account for the asperity of the
little lady's tone; but he remembered that Julia had
never been a favorite with her aunt.</p>

<p>"I'm convinced," said Mrs. Dysart, "that woman
died for want of something. Something that she'd got
used to till it was absolutely necessary to her. Something,
whatever it was, that had completely satisfied
her. When she found herself without it, <i>that</i>, I imagine,
constituted the shock. And she wasn't strong
enough to stand it, that was all."</p>

<p>Mrs. Dysart spoke to her niece, but he felt that there
was something in her, fiery and indignant, that hurled
itself across Julia at him.</p>

<p>He changed the subject.</p>

<p>"She&mdash;she left nothing?"</p>

<p>"Not a note, not a line."</p>

<p>"Ah, well, what we have is beautiful enough for
anybody."</p>

<p>"I wonder if you have any idea what you might have
had? If you even knew what it was you had?"</p>

<p>"I never presumed," he said, "to understand her.
I've hardly ever known any woman properly but one."</p>

<p>"And knowing one woman&mdash;properly or improperly&mdash;won't
help you to understand another. <i>I</i> never knew
there was so much in her."</p>

<p>"She didn't know it herself. She used to say it
wasn't in her. It was the most mysterious thing I
ever saw."</p>

<p>It was his turn to shelter himself behind Freda's gift.
He piled up words, and his mind cowered behind them,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
thinking no thought, seeing nothing but Freda's dead
face with its shut eyes.</p>

<p>"What was it?" he said. "Where did it come from?"</p>

<p>"It came," said Mrs. Dysart, "from somewhere deep
down in her heart, a part of her that had only one
chance to show itself." She rose and delivered herself
of all her fire. "There was something in Freda infinitely
greater, infinitely more beautiful, than her gift.
It showed itself only once in her life. When it couldn't
show itself any more the gift left her. We can't account
for it."</p>

<p>He followed her to the door. She pressed his hand
as she said good-bye to him, and he saw that there
were tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>"I told you," she said, "to do all you could for her.
She knew that you had done&mdash;all you could."</p>

<p>He bowed his head to her rebuke.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Upstairs Julia was waiting for him. Her pale face
turned to him as he came in.</p>

<p>He saw a hunger in it that was not of the soul.</p>

<p>He had never been greatly interested in Julia's soul,
and till now her face had told him nothing of it. It
had clipped it tight, like the covers of a narrow book.
He had never cared to open it. Freda's soul was like
an illuminated missal, treasured under transparence;
its divine secret flamed, unafraid, in scarlet and gold.</p>

<p>He did not take his seat beside her, but stood off
from her, distant and uneasy. She rose and laid her
hand upon his arm, and he drew back from her touch.</p>

<p>"Wilton," she said, "you are not going to let this
trouble you?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's the good of talking? It won't undo what
we did."</p>

<p>"What <i>we</i> did?"</p>

<p>"I, then."</p>

<p>"What else could you do?"</p>

<p>He did not answer, and she murmured, "Or I? I
was right. She <i>was</i> in love with you."</p>

<p>He turned on her.</p>

<p>"I wish," he said, "you had never told me."

<h3>I</h3>

<p>Gibson used to say that he would never marry, because
no other woman could be half as nice as his own
mother. Then, of course, he broke his mother's heart
by marrying a woman who was not nice at all.</p>

<p>He was a powerful fellow with a plain, square face,
and a manner that was perfection to the people whom
he liked. Unfortunately they were very few. He did
not like any of the ladies whom his mother wanted
him to like, not even when they reproduced for him
her gentle, delicate distinction.</p>

<p>The younger Mrs. Gibson had none of it. But she
had ways with her, and a power that was said to reside
supremely in her hands, her arms, and her hair. Especially
her hair (she was the large white and golden
kind). It was long as a lasso and ample as a cloak.
Gibson loved her hair. The sight and the scent of it
filled him with folly. He liked to braid and unbraid it,
to lay his face against it, to plunge his hands through
the coolness into the warmth of it.</p>

<p>It seemed to him to give out the splendor and vitality
of her, to have a secret sympathy with the thought
that stirred beneath it.</p>

<p>She had a trick, when she was thinking of caressing
it, of winding and unwinding the little curls that
sprang, aureolewise, above her temples. That was one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
of her ways, and it brought her hands and arms into
play with stupendous effect.</p>

<p>He would sit opposite her a whole evening, watching
it, dumb with excess of happiness.</p>

<p>It took him six months to find out that the trick
he admired so much was a sign that his wife was bored
to extinction.</p>

<p>"Is there anything you want?" he said.</p>

<p>She laughed hysterically.</p>

<p>"You've only to say what you want, and I'll get it
for you, if it can be got."</p>

<p>"It could be got all right," said she. "But I doubt
whether you'd care very much to get it."</p>

<p>"What is it? Tell me&mdash;tell me."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;you're very nice, my dear, I know. But before
I married you I used&mdash;though you mightn't think
it&mdash;to be received in society."</p>

<p>He took her back to it. He said he was a selfish
brute to want to keep her to himself. That speech
amused Mrs. Gibson immensely. She had a curious
and capricious sense of humor. It made her very
adaptable and tided them both over a sharp season of
infelicity.</p>

<p>Hitherto Mrs. Gibson had been merely bored. Now
she was seized with a malady of unrest. Any other
man but Gibson would have been driven mad with her
nerves.</p>

<p>"You're doing too much, you know," he said, soothing
her. "You're tired."</p>

<p>She raised her eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she said, "not <i>tired</i>."</p>

<p>He meditated.</p>

<p>"What you want," said he, "is a thorough change."</p>

<p>"My dear," said she, "I didn't know you were so
clever."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>"Would you like me to take a cottage in the country?"</p>

<p>"A cottage? In the country?"</p>

<p>"Well, of course, not too far from town. Some place
where I could run down for the week-ends."</p>

<p>"You couldn't," said she, "be running down oftener?"</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I'm afraid I couldn't just at present."</p>

<p>"Don't you think it might be a trifle lonely?"</p>

<p>"You can have anyone you like to stay with you."</p>

<p>She smiled.</p>

<p>"And you really want to take it? This cottage?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said she, "take it by all means, and
lose no time."</p>

<p>He took it, and went down with her for the first
week-end.</p>

<p>It was a tiny place. But some one had built a comfortable
smoking-room at the back. It opened by glass
doors into the garden.</p>

<p>One Sunday evening they were sitting together in
the smoking-room when she flung herself down on the
floor beside him and laid her head on his knee. She
seized his hand and drew it down to her.</p>

<p>"As you are going to leave me to-morrow," she said,
"you can stroke my hair to-night."</p>

<p>He went down every week-end. And every week-end
he found an improvement in his wife's health.
When he complimented her upon her appearance, she
told him she had been gardening. He took it as an
excellent sign that she should be fond of gardening.</p>

<p>Then one day Gibson (who worked like ten horses to
provide all the things that his wife wanted) got ill and
was told to take a month off in the country.</p>

<p>That was in the middle of the week. He saw his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
doctor early in the evening and took the last train
down. The cottage was several miles from the nearest
telegraph office, so that he arrived before the wire that
should have announced his coming.</p>

<p>A short cut from the station brought him to the back
of the house through a little wood that screened it.
The wood path led into his garden by a private gate
which was always locked.</p>

<p>He climbed the gate and crossed the grass plot to
the glass doors of the smoking-room. The lamps were
lit there, and Gibson, as he approached, could see his
wife sitting in the low chair opposite his. His heart
bounded at the sight of her. He was glad to think that
she sat in his room when he was away. He walked
quickly over the grass and stood at the glass doors
looking in.</p>

<p>She was lying back in the low chair. In <i>his</i> chair,
which a curtain had concealed from him until now,
there sat a man he knew. He recognized the narrow
shoulders and the head with the sleek brown hair,
showing a little sallow patch of baldness at the back.
From a certain tenseness in the man's attitude he knew
that his gaze was fastened on the woman who faced
them. Her left arm was raised, its long, loose sleeve
fell back and bared it. Her fingers twisted and untwisted
a little straying curl.</p>

<p>The man could bear it no longer. He jumped up and
went to her. He knelt beside her. With one hand he
seized her arm by the full white wrist and dragged it
down and held it to his lips. The other hand smoothed
back her hair into its place and held it there. His fine,
nervous fingers sank through the deep, silky web to
the white, sensitive skin. The woman threw back her
head and closed her eyes, every nerve throbbing felinely
under the caress she loved.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>The man rose with an uneasy movement that
brought him to the back of her chair. He stooped and
whispered something. She flung up her arms and drew
down his face to hers under the white arch they made.</p>

<p>Gibson did nothing scandalous. He went round
quietly to the front door and let himself in with his
latch-key. When he entered the smoking-room he
found his wife there alone. She stood on his hearth,
and met him with hard eyes, desperate and defiant.</p>

<p>"What have you to say for yourself?" he said.</p>

<p>"Everything," said she. "Of course you will divorce
me."</p>

<p>"Will a separation not satisfy you?"</p>

<p>"No," she said, "it will not. If you haven't had
proof enough I can give you more. Or you can ask
the servants."</p>

<p>He had always given her what she wanted. He
gave it her now.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Gibson went back to his mother.</p>

<p>The incident left him apparently unscathed. He
showed no signs of trouble until four years after, when
his mother died. Then the two shocks rolled into one,
and for a year Gibson was a wreck.</p>

<p>At last he was told, as he had been told before, to
stop work and go away&mdash;anywhere&mdash;for a rest. He
went to a small seaside town in East Devon.</p>

<p>The man's nature was so sound that in a month's
time he recovered sufficiently to take an interest in
what was going on around him.</p>

<p>He was lodged in one of a row of small houses facing
the esplanade. Each had its own plot of green garden
spread before it, and a flagged pathway leading from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
the gate to the door. Path and garden were raised a
good half-foot above the level of the sidewalk, and this
half-foot, Gibson observed, was a serious embarrassment
to his next-door neighbors.</p>

<p>Twice a day a bath-chair with an old gentleman in
it would emerge from the <a class="corr" name="TC_1" id="TC_1" title="dorway">doorway</a> of the house next
door. It was drawn by two little ladies, a dark one and
a fair one, whom Gibson judged to be the old gentleman's
daughters. He must have weighed considerably,
that old gentleman, and the ladies (especially the dark
one) were far too young and small and tender for such
draft-work. Four times a day at the garden-gate a
struggle took place between little ladies and the bath-chair.
Gibson could see them from his window where
he lay, supine in his nervous apathy. Their going out
was only less fearful than their coming in. Going out,
it was very hard to prevent the back wheels from
slipping down with a bump on to the pavement and
shaking the old gentleman horribly. Coming in, they
risked overturning him altogether.</p>

<p>You would not have known that there was any
struggle going on. The old gentleman bore himself
with so calm and high a heroism; the little ladies were
sustained by so pure a sense of the humors of the bath-chair.
No sharp, irritating cries escaped them. They
did nothing but laugh softly as they pulled and pushed
and tugged with their women's arms, and heaved with
delicate shoulders, or hung on, in their frenzy, from
behind while the bath-chair swayed ponderously and
perilously above the footway.</p>

<p>Gibson sometimes wondered whether he oughtn't to
rush out and help them. But he couldn't. He didn't
really care.</p>

<p>His landlady told him that the old gentleman was a
General Richardson, that he was paralyzed, that his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
daughters waited on him hand and foot, that they were
too poor to afford a man-servant to look after him
and push the bath-chair. It wasn't much of a life,
the woman said, for the two young ladies. Gibson
agreed that it wasn't much of a life, certainly.</p>

<p>What pleased him was the fine levity with which
they took it. He was always meeting them in their
walks on the esplanade. Sometimes they would come
racing down the wind with the bath-chair, their serge
skirts blown forward, their hair curling over the brims
of their sailor hats. (The dark one was particularly
attractive in a high wind.) Then they would come
back much impeded, their skirts wrapped tight above
their knees, their little bodies bent to the storm, their
faces wearing still that invincible gaiety of theirs.
Sometimes, on a gentle incline, they would let the bath-chair
run on a little by itself, till it threatened a dangerous
independence, when they would fly after it at
the top of their speed and arrest it just in time. Gibson
could never make out whether they did this for their
own amusement or the old gentleman's. But sometimes,
when the General came careering past him, he
could catch the glance of a bright and affable eye that
seemed to call on him to observe the extent to which
an old fellow might enjoy himself yet.</p>

<p>Gibson's lodging gave him endless opportunity for
studying the habits of his little ladies. He learned
that they did everything in turns. They took it in
turns to pull the bath-chair and to push it. They
took it in turns to read aloud to the old gentleman,
and to put him to bed at night and get him up in the
morning. They took it in turns to go to church (did
they become suddenly serious, he wondered, there?),
and in turns to air themselves on a certain little plateau
on the cliffside.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>He was next to find out that they nursed the monstrous
ambition of urging the bath-chair up the hill
and landing it on the plateau. Gibson was sorry for
them, for he knew they could never do it. But such
was their determination that each time he encountered
them on the hill they had struggled a little farther
up it.</p>

<p>The road had a sort of hump in it just before it
forked off on to the cliff. That baffled them.</p>

<p>At last, as he himself was returning from the plateau,
he came upon the sisters right in the middle of the
rise, locked in deadly combat with the bath-chair.
Pressed against it, shoulder to shoulder, they resisted
its efforts to hurl itself violently backward down the
hill. The General, as he clung to the arms of the
chair, preserved his attitude of superb indifference to
the event.</p>

<p>Gibson leaped to their assistance. With a threefold
prodigious effort they topped the rise, and in silence,
in a sort of solemn triumph, the bath-chair was wheeled
on to the plateau.</p>

<p>He liked the simplicity with which they accepted his
aid, and he liked the way they thanked him, both
sisters becoming very grave all at once. It was the fair
one who spoke. The dark one only bowed and smiled
as he lifted his cap and turned away.</p>

<p>"It's all very well," he heard her saying, "but how
are we going to get him down again?"</p>

<p>How were they?</p>

<p>He hung about the cliffside till the time came for
them to return, when he presented himself as if by
accident.</p>

<p>"You must allow me," he said, "to see you safe to
the bottom of the hill."</p>

<p>They allowed him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>"You see" (the General addressed his daughters as
they paused halfway), "we've accomplished it, and no
bones are broken."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Gibson, "but isn't the expedition just a
little dangerous?"</p>

<p>"Ah," said the General, "I've risked my life too
many times to mind a little danger now."</p>

<p>Gibson's eyebrows said plainly, "It wasn't <i>your</i> life,
old boy, I was thinking of."</p>

<p>The sisters looked away.</p>

<p>"You must never attempt that again," he said
gravely, as he parted from them at the foot of the hill.</p>

<p>Gibson felt that he had done a good morning's work.
He had saved the lives of the three Richardsons, and
he had found out that the fair one's name was Effie,
and the dark one's Ph&oelig;be.</p>

<p>After that the acquaintance ripened. They exchanged
salutes whenever they met. Then Gibson,
moved beyond endurance by their daily strife with the
bath-chair, was generally to be seen at their gateway
in time to help them.</p>

<p>As the days grew longer the Richardsons began to
take their tea out of doors on their grass-plot. And
then it seemed to strike them all at once that the
gentleman next door was lonely, and one afternoon
they invited him to tea.</p>

<p>Then Gibson had his tea served on <i>his</i> grass plot,
and invited the Richardsons, and the Richardsons (they
were so absurdly grateful) invited him to supper and
to spend the evening. They thanked him for coming.
"It was such a pleasure," Effie said (Effie was the
elder), "such a great pleasure to Father."</p>

<p>Gibson hardly thought his society could be a pleasure
to anyone, but he tried to make himself useful.
He engaged himself as the General's bath-chair man.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
He bowled him along at the round pace he loved, while
the little ladies, Effie and Ph&oelig;be, trotted after them,
friendly and gay.</p>

<p>And he began to go in and out next door as a matter
of course, till it was open to the little sisters to regard
him as their own very valuable property. But they
were not going to be selfish about him. Oh, no! They
took him, as they took everything else, in turns. They
tried hard to divide him fairly. If he attached himself
to Effie (the fair one), Effie would grow uneasy, and
she would get up and positively hand him over to
Ph&oelig;be (the dark one). If Ph&oelig;be permitted herself to
talk to him for any while, her eyes would call to Effie,
and when Effie came she would slip away and take up
her sad place by the General's armchair. In their
innocent rivalry it was who could give him more up
to the other. And, as Ph&oelig;be was the more determined
little person, it was Ph&oelig;be who generally had
it her own way. "Father," too, came in for his just
share. Gibson felt that he would not be tolerated on
any footing that kept "Father" out of it. There was
also a moment in the evening when he would be led
up to the armchair, and both Effie and Ph&oelig;be would
withdraw and leave him to that communion.</p>

<p>There was a third sister he knew now. She was
the eldest, and her name was Mary. She was away
somewhere in the north, recovering, he gathered, from
"Father" (of course, they took it in turns to recover
from him), while Father wandered up and down the
south coast, endeavoring, vainly, to recover from himself.
They told Gibson that the one thing that spoiled
it all (the joy, they meant, of their intercourse with
him) was the thought that Mary was "missing it."
Had Mary been there she would have had to have her
share, her fourth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently he realized that Ph&oelig;be (he supposed because
of her superior determination) had effaced herself
altogether. She was always doing dreary things,
he noticed, out of her turn. Then he perceived a
change in her. Little Ph&oelig;be, in consequence of all
the dreary things she did, was beginning to grow thin
and pale. She looked as though she wanted more of
the tonic air of the cliffside. She did still take her turn
at climbing to the plateau and sitting there all alone.
But that, Gibson reflected, was after all, for Ph&oelig;be, a
very dreary thing to do.</p>

<p>One evening he took courage, and asked Ph&oelig;be to
come for a walk to the cliffside with him.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be did not answer all at once. She shrank, he
could see, from the enormity of having him all to
herself.</p>

<p>"Go," said Effie, "it will do you worlds of good."</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> go."</p>

<p>Effie laughed and shook her head.</p>

<p>"Come too, then. Mr. Gibson, say she's to come
too."</p>

<p>"You know," said Effie, "it's my turn to stay with
Father."</p>

<p>She said it severely, as if Ph&oelig;be had been trying
unfairly to deprive her of a privilege and a delight.
They were delicious, Ph&oelig;be and Effie, but it was
Ph&oelig;be that he wanted this time.</p>

<p>They set out at a brisk pace that brought the blood
to Ph&oelig;be's cheeks and made her prettier than ever.
Ph&oelig;be, of course, had done her best to make her prettiness
entirely unobtrusive. She wore a muslin skirt
and a tie, and a sailor hat that was not specially becoming
to her small head, and her serge skirt had to
be both wide and short because of pushing the bath-chair
about through all kinds of weather. But the sea
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
wind caught her; it played with her hair; it blew a
little dark curl out of place to hang distractingly over
Ph&oelig;be's left ear; it blew the serge skirt tight about her
limbs, and showed him, in spite of Ph&oelig;be, how prettily
Ph&oelig;be was made.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you back me up?" said Ph&oelig;be. "She
wanted to come all the time."</p>

<p>He turned, as he walked, to look at her.</p>

<p>"Why didn't I back you up? Do you really want to
know why?"</p>

<p>Whenever he took that tone Ph&oelig;be looked solemn
and a little frightened. She was frightened now, too
frightened to answer him.</p>

<p>"Because," said he, "I wanted you all to myself."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;&mdash;" Ph&oelig;be drew a long, terrified breath.</p>

<p>There are many ways of saying "Oh," but Gibson
had never, never in his whole life heard any woman
say it as Ph&oelig;be said it then. It meant that she was
staggered at anybody's having the temerity to want
anything all to himself.</p>

<p>"Do you think me very selfish?"</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be assured him instantly that that had never
been her idea of him.</p>

<p>"Shall I tell you who is selfish?"</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be's little mouth hardened. She was so dreadfully
afraid that he was going to say "Your father."</p>

<p>"You," he said, "you."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I am," said she. "It's so hard not to
be."</p>

<p>He stood still in his astonishment, so that she had
to stand still, too.</p>

<p>"Of course it's hard not to give up things, when
you like giving them up. But your sister likes giving
them up, too, and it's selfish of you to prevent her,
isn't it?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, but you don't know what it's been&mdash;Effie's life
and Mary's."</p>

<p>"And yours&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I'm happy enough. I'm the youngest."</p>

<p>"You mean you've had a year or two less of it."</p>

<p>"Yes. They never told me, for fear of making me
unhappy, when Father's illness came."</p>

<p>"How long ago was that?"</p>

<p>"Five years ago. I was at school."</p>

<p>He made a brief calculation. During the two years
of his married life Ph&oelig;be had been a child at school.</p>

<p>"And two years," said Ph&oelig;be, "is a long time to be
happy in."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "it's a long time."</p>

<p>"And then," she went on presently, "I'm so much
stronger than Effie and Mary."</p>

<p>"Not strong enough to go dragging that abominable
bath-chair about."</p>

<p>"Not strong enough? Look&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She held out her right arm for him to look at; under
her muslin blouse he saw its tense roundness, and its
whiteness through the slit above her wrist.</p>

<p>His heart stirred in him. Ph&oelig;be's arms were beautiful,
and they were strong to help.</p>

<p>"I wish," he said, "I could make it better for you."</p>

<p>"Oh, but you <i>have</i> made it better for us. You can't
think what a difference you've made."</p>

<p>"Have I? Have I?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Effie said so only the other day. She wrote
it to Mary. And Mary says it's a shame she can't
be here. It is, you know. It makes us feel so mean
having you all to ourselves like this."</p>

<p>He laughed. He laughed whenever he thought of it.
There was nobody who could say things as Ph&oelig;be said
them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish," said she, "you knew Mary. You'd like her
so."</p>

<p>"I'm sure I should if she's at all like you."</p>

<p>(Her innocence sheltered him, made him bold.)</p>

<p>"Oh, but she isn't."</p>

<p>And he listened while she gave him a long list of
Mary's charms. (Dear little, tender, unconscious
Ph&oelig;be.)</p>

<p>"She sounds," he said, "very like you."</p>

<p>"She isn't the least bit like me. You don't know
me."</p>

<p>"Don't I?"</p>

<p>"Mary's coming back at the end of the month. Then
either I or Effie will go away. Do you think you'll
still be here?"</p>

<p>He seemed to her to answer absently.</p>

<p>"Which of you, did you say, was going away?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;it's Effie's turn."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "I think I shall still be here."</p>

<p>One night, a week later, the two sisters sat talking
together long after "Father" had been put to bed.</p>

<p>"Ph&oelig;be," said Effie, "why did you want me to come
with you and Mr. Gibson?"</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;&mdash;" said Ph&oelig;be.</p>

<p>"My dear, it's you he likes, not me."</p>

<p>"Don't, Effie."</p>

<p>"But it's true," said Effie.</p>

<p>"How can you tell?" said Ph&oelig;be, and she felt perfidious.</p>

<p>"Isn't he always going about with you?"</p>

<p>But Ph&oelig;be was ingenious in the destruction of her
own joy.</p>

<p>"Oh," said she, "that's his cunning. He likes you
dreadfully. He goes about with me, just to hide it."</p>

<p>"You goose."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you sure, Effie, you don't care?"</p>

<p>"Not a rap."</p>

<p>"You never have? Not in the beginning?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not in the beginning. I only thought
he might be nice for you."</p>

<p>"You didn't even want to divide him?"</p>

<p>Effie shook her head vehemently.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;he's the only thing I ever wanted all to myself.
If&mdash;&mdash;" Then Ph&oelig;be looked frightened. "Effie,"
she said, "he's never said anything."</p>

<p>"All the same, you <i>know</i>."</p>

<p>"Can you know?"</p>

<p>"I think so," said Effie.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Gibson had been talking a long time to Ph&oelig;be.
They were sitting together on the beach, under the
shadow of the cliff. He was trying to form Ph&oelig;be's
mind. Ph&oelig;be's mind was deliciously young, and it
had the hunger and thirst of youth. A little shy and
difficult to approach, Ph&oelig;be's mind, but he had found
out what it liked best, and it pleased him to see how
confidingly and delicately it, so to speak, ate out of
his hand.</p>

<p>He puzzled her a good deal. And she had a very
pretty way of closing her eyes when she was puzzled.
In another woman it would have meant that he was
boring her; Ph&oelig;be did it to shut out the intolerable
light of knowledge.</p>

<p>"Ah!&mdash;don't," he cried.</p>

<p>"Don't shut my eyes? I always shut my eyes when
I'm trying to think," said Ph&oelig;be.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>He said nothing. That was not what he had meant
when he had said "Don't."</p>

<p>"Am I boring you?" he said presently. His tone
jarred a little on Ph&oelig;be; he had such a nice voice
generally.</p>

<p>"No," said she. "Why?"</p>

<p>"Because you keep on doing that."</p>

<p>"Doing what?"</p>

<p>"That."</p>

<p>"Oh!&mdash;this?"</p>

<p>She put up her hand and untwisted the little tendril
of brown hair that hung deliciously over her left ear.</p>

<p>"I always do that when I'm thinking."</p>

<p>He very nearly said, "Then, for God's sake, don't
think."</p>

<p>But Ph&oelig;be was always thinking now. He had given
her cause to think.</p>

<p>He began to hate the little brown curl that hung
over her left ear, though it was anguish to him to hate
anything that was Ph&oelig;be's. He looked out with nervous
anxiety for the movement of her little white hand.
He said to himself, "If she does it again, I can't come
near her any more."</p>

<p>Yet he kept on coming; and was happy with her
until Ph&oelig;be (poor, predestined little Ph&oelig;be) did it
again. Gibson shuddered with the horror of the thing.
He kept on saying to himself, "She's sweet, she's good,
she's adorable. It isn't her fault. But I can't&mdash;I can't
sit in the room with it."</p>

<p>And the next minute Ph&oelig;be would be so adorable
that he would repent miserably of his brutality.</p>

<p>Then, one hot, still evening, he was alone with her
in the little sitting-room. Outside, on the grass plot,
her father sat in his bath-chair while Effie read aloud
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
to him (out of her turn). Her voice made a cover for
Gibson's voice and Ph&oelig;be's.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be was dressed (for the heat) in a white gown
with wide, open sleeves. Her low collar showed the
pure, soft swell of her neck to the shoulder-line.</p>

<p>She was sitting upright and demure in a straight-backed
chair, with her hands folded quietly in her lap.</p>

<p>"That isn't a very comfortable chair you've got,"
he said.</p>

<p>He knew that she was tired with pushing the bath-chair
about all day.</p>

<p>"It's the one I always sit in," said Ph&oelig;be.</p>

<p>"Well, you're not going to sit in it now," he said.</p>

<p>He drew the armchair out of its sacred corner and
made her sit in that. He put a cushion at her head
and a footstool at her feet.</p>

<p>"You make my heart ache," he said.</p>

<p>"Do I?"</p>

<p>He could not tell whether the little shaking breath
she drew were a laugh or a sigh.</p>

<p>She lay back, letting her tired body slacken into rest.</p>

<p>The movement loosened the little combs that kept
the coil of her brown hair in place. Ph&oelig;be abhorred
dishevelment. She put up her hands to her head. Her
wide sleeve fell back, showing the full length of her
white arms.</p>

<p>He saw another woman stretching her arms to the
man who leaned above her. He saw the movement of
her hands&mdash;hands of the same texture and whiteness
as her body, instinct with its impulses. A long procession
of abominations passed through the white arch
of her arms&mdash;the arch she raised in triumph and defiance,
immortalizing her sin.</p>

<p>He was very tender with Ph&oelig;be that night, for his
heart was wrung with compunction.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>"She's adorable," he said to himself; "but I can't
live with <i>that</i>."</p>

<p>Gibson left by the early train next day. He went
without saying good-bye and without leaving an explanation
or an address.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be held her head high, and said, day after day,
"There's sure to be a letter."</p>

<p>Three weeks passed and no letter came. Ph&oelig;be saw
that it was all over.</p>

<p>One day she was found (Effie found her) on her bed,
crying. She was so weak she let Effie take her in her
arms.</p>

<p>"If I only knew what I had done," she said. "Oh,
Effie! what could have made him go away?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell, my lamb. You mustn't think about
him any more."</p>

<p>"I can't help thinking. You see, it's not as if he
hadn't been so nice."</p>

<p>"He couldn't have been nice to treat you that way."</p>

<p>"He didn't," said Ph&oelig;be fiercely. "He didn't treat
me any way. I sometimes think I must have made it
all up out of my own head. Did I?"</p>

<p>"No, no. I'm sure you didn't."</p>

<p>"It would have been awful of me. But I'd rather
be awful than have to think that he was. What is
my worst fault, Effie?"</p>

<p>"Your worst fault, in his eyes, is that you have
none."</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be sat up on the edge of the bed. She was
thinking hard. And as she thought her hand went up,
caressing unconsciously the little brown curl.</p>

<p>"If I only knew," said she, "what I had done!"</p>

<p>Gibson never saw Ph&oelig;be Richardson again. But a
year later, as he turned suddenly on to the esplanade
of a strange watering-place, he encountered the bath-chair,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
drawn by Effie and another lady. He made
way, lifting his cap mechanically to its occupant.</p>

<p>The General looked at him. The courteous old hand
checked itself in the salute. The affable smile died
grimly.</p>

<p>Effie turned away her head. The other lady (it must
have been "Mary") raised her eyes in somber curiosity.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be was not with them. Gibson supposed that
she was away somewhere, recovering, in her turn.

<h2><a name="WILKINSONS_WIFE" id="WILKINSONS_WIFE"></a>WILKINSON'S WIFE</h2>

<hr class="w25" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>Nobody ever understood why he married her.</p>

<p>You expected calamity to pursue Wilkinson&mdash;it always
had pursued him&mdash;; but that Wilkinson should
have gone out of his way to pursue calamity (as if
he could never have enough of it) really seemed a
most unnecessary thing.</p>

<p>For there had been no pursuit on the part of the
lady. Wilkinson's wife had the quality of her defects,
and revealed herself chiefly in a formidable reluctance.
It was understood that Wilkinson had prevailed only
after an austere struggle. Her appearance sufficiently
refuted any theory of unholy fascination or disastrous
charm.</p>

<p>Wilkinson's wife was not at all nice to look at. She
had an insignificant figure, a small, square face, colorless
hair scraped with difficulty to the top of her head,
eyes with no lashes to protect you from their stare,
a mouth that pulled at an invisible curb, a sallow skin
stretched so tight over her cheek-bones that the red
veins stood stagnant there; and with it all, poor lady, a
dull, strained expression hostile to further intimacy.</p>

<p>Even in her youth she never could have looked
young, and she was years older than Wilkinson. Not
that the difference showed, for his marriage had made
Wilkinson look years older than he was; at least, so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
it was said by people who had known him before that
unfortunate event.</p>

<p>It was not even as if she had been intelligent. Wilkinson
had a gentle passion for the things of intellect;
his wife seemed to exist on purpose to frustrate it. In
no department of his life was her influence so penetrating
and malign. At forty he no longer counted; he
had lost all his brilliance, and had replaced it by a shy,
unworldly charm. There was something in Wilkinson
that dreamed or slept, with one eye open, fixed upon
his wife. Of course, he had his blessed hours of deliverance
from the woman. Sometimes he would fly
in her face and ask people to dine at his house in
Hampstead, to discuss Roman remains, or the Troubadours,
or Nietzsche. He never could understand why
his wife couldn't "enter," as he expressed it, into these
subjects. He smiled at you in the dimmest, saddest
way when he referred to it. "It's extraordinary," he
would say, "the little interest she takes in Nietzsche."</p>

<p>Mrs. Norman found him once wandering in the High
Street, with his passion full on him. He was a little
absent, a little flushed; his eyes shone behind his spectacles;
and there were pleasant creases in his queer,
clean-shaven face.</p>

<p>She inquired the cause of his delight.</p>

<p>"I've got a man coming to dine this evening, to have
a little talk with me. He knows all about the Troubadours."</p>

<p>And Wilkinson would try and make you believe that
they had threshed out the Troubadours between them.
But when Mrs. Norman, who was a little curious about
Wilkinson, asked the Troubadour man what they <i>had</i>
talked about, he smiled and said it was something&mdash;some
extraordinary adventure&mdash;that had happened to
Wilkinson's wife.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>People always smiled when they spoke of her. Then,
one by one, they left off dining with Wilkinson. The
man who read Nietzsche was quite rude about it. He
said he wasn't going there to be gagged by that woman.
He would have been glad enough to ask Wilkinson to
dine with him if he would go without his wife.</p>

<p>If it had not been for Mrs. Norman the Wilkinsons
would have vanished from the social scene. Mrs. Norman
had taken Wilkinson up, and it was evident that
she did not mean to let him go. That, she would have
told you with engaging emphasis, was not her way.
She had seen how things were going, socially, with
Wilkinson, and she was bent on his deliverance.</p>

<p>If anybody could have carried it through, it would
have been Mrs. Norman. She was clever; she was
charming; she had a house in Fitzjohn's Avenue, where
she entertained intimately. At forty she had preserved
the best part of her youth and prettiness, and
an income insufficient for Mr. Norman, but enough for
her. As she said in her rather dubious pathos, she
had nobody but herself to please now.</p>

<p>You gathered that if Mr. Norman had been living
he would not have been pleased with her cultivation
of the Wilkinsons. She was always asking them to
dinner. They turned up punctually at her delightful
Friday evenings (her little evenings) from nine to
eleven. They dropped in to tea on Sunday afternoons.
Mrs. Norman had a wonderful way of drawing
Wilkinson out; while Evey, her unmarried sister, made
prodigious efforts to draw Wilkinson's wife in. "If you
could only make her," said Mrs. Norman, "take an
interest in something."</p>

<p>But Evey couldn't make her take an interest in anything.
Evey had no sympathy with her sister's missionary
adventure. She saw what Mrs. Norman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
wouldn't see&mdash;that, if they forced Mrs. Wilkinson on
people who were trying to keep away from her, people
would simply keep away from them. Their Fridays
were not so well attended, so delightful, as they had
been. A heavy cloud of dulness seemed to come into
the room, with Mrs. Wilkinson, at nine o'clock. It
hung about her chair, and spread slowly, till everybody
was wrapped in it.</p>

<p>Then Evey protested. She wanted to know why
Cornelia allowed their evenings to be blighted thus.
"Why ask Mrs. Wilkinson?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't," said Cornelia, "if there was any other
way of getting him."</p>

<p>"Well," said Evey, "he's nice enough, but it's rather
a large price to have to pay."</p>

<p>"And is he," cried Cornelia passionately, "to be cut
off from everything because of that one terrible mistake?"</p>

<p>Evey said nothing. If Cornelia were going to take
him that way, there was nothing to be said!</p>

<p>So Mrs. Norman went on drawing Wilkinson out
more and more, till one Sunday afternoon, sitting beside
her on the sofa, he emerged positively splendid.
There were moments when he forgot about his wife.</p>

<p>They had been talking together about his blessed
Troubadours. (It was wonderful the interest Mrs.
Norman took in them!) Suddenly his gentleness and
sadness fell from him, a flame sprang up behind his
spectacles, and the something that slept or dreamed
in Wilkinson awoke. He was away with Mrs. Norman
in a lovely land, in Provence of the thirteenth century.
A strange chant broke from him; it startled Evey,
where she sat at the other end of the room. He was
reciting his own translation of a love-song of Provence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>At the first words of the refrain his wife, who had
never ceased staring at him, got up and came across
the room. She touched his shoulder just as he was
going to say "Ma mie."</p>

<p>"Come, Peter," she said, "it's time to be going
home."</p>

<p>Wilkinson rose on his long legs. "Ma mie," he said,
looking down at her; and the flaming dream was still
in his eyes behind his spectacles.</p>

<p>He took the little cloak she held out to him, a
pitiful and rather vulgar thing. He raised it with the
air of a courtier handling a royal robe; then he put it
on her, smoothing it tenderly about her shoulders.</p>

<p>Mrs. Norman followed them to the porch. As he
turned to her on the step, she saw that his eyes were
sad, and that his face, as she put it, had gone to sleep
again.</p>

<p>When she came back to her sister, her own eyes
shone and her face was rosy.</p>

<p>"Oh, Evey," she said, "isn't it beautiful?"</p>

<p>"Isn't what beautiful?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Wilkinson's behavior to his wife."</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>It was not an easy problem that Mrs. Norman faced.
She wished to save Wilkinson; she also wished to save
the character of her Fridays, which Wilkinson's wife
had already done her best to destroy. Mrs. Norman
could not think why the woman came, since she didn't
enjoy herself, since she was impenetrable to the intimate,
peculiar charm. You could only suppose that
her object was to prevent its penetrating Wilkinson,
to keep the other women off. Her eyes never left him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>It was all very well for Evey to talk. She <i>might</i>,
of course, have been wiser in the beginning. She might
have confined the creature to their big monthly crushes,
where, as Evey had suggested, she would easily have
been mislaid and lost. But so, unfortunately, would
Wilkinson; and the whole point was how not to lose
him.</p>

<p>Evey said she was tired of being told off to entertain
Mrs. Wilkinson. She was beginning to be rather
disagreeable about it. She said Cornelia was getting
to care too much about that Wilkinson man. She
wouldn't have minded playing up to her if she had
approved of the game; but Mrs. Wilkinson was, after
all, you know, Mr. Wilkinson's wife.</p>

<p>Mrs. Norman cried a little. She told Evey she ought
to have known it was his spirit that she cared about.
But she owned that it wasn't right to sacrifice poor
Evey. Neither, since he <i>had</i> a wife, was it altogether
right for her to care about Wilkinson's spirit to the
exclusion of her other friends.</p>

<p>Then, one Friday, Mrs. Norman, relieving her sister
for once, made a discovery while Evey, who was a fine
musician, played. Mrs. Wilkinson did, after all, take
an interest in something; she was accessible to the
throbbing of Evey's bow across the strings.</p>

<p>She had started; her eyes had turned from Wilkinson
and fastened on the player. There was a light in
them, beautiful and piercing, as if her soul had suddenly
been released from some hiding-place in its unlovely
house. Her face softened, her mouth relaxed,
her eyes closed. She lay back in her chair, at peace,
withdrawn from them, positively lost.</p>

<p>Mrs. Norman slipped across the room to the corner
where Wilkinson sat alone. His face lightened as she
came.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's extraordinary," he said, "her love of music."</p>

<p>Mrs. Norman assented. It <i>was</i> extraordinary, if you
came to think of it. Mrs. Wilkinson had no understanding
of the art. What did it mean to her? Where
did it take her? You could see she was transported,
presumably to some place of chartered stupidity, of
condoned oblivion, where nobody could challenge her
right to enter and remain.</p>

<p>"So soothing," said Wilkinson, "to the nerves."</p>

<p>Mrs. Norman smiled at him. She felt that, under
cover of the music, his spirit was seeking communion
with hers.</p>

<p>He thanked her at parting; the slight hush and
mystery of his manner intimated that she had found
a way.</p>

<p>"I hope," she said, "you'll come often&mdash;often."</p>

<p>"May we? May we?" He seemed to leap at it&mdash;as
if they hadn't come often enough before!</p>

<p>Certainly she had found the way&mdash;the way to deliver
him, the way to pacify his wife, to remove her
gently to her place and keep her there.</p>

<p>The dreadful lady thus creditably disposed of, Wilkinson
was no longer backward in the courting of his
opportunity. He proved punctual to the first minute
of the golden hour.</p>

<p>Hampstead was immensely interested in his blossoming
forth. It found a touching simplicity in the
way he lent himself to the sympathetic eye. All the
world was at liberty to observe his intimacy with Mrs.
Norman.</p>

<p>It endured for nine weeks. Then suddenly, to Mrs.
Norman's bewilderment, it ceased. The Wilkinsons
left off coming to her Friday evenings. They refused
her invitations. Their behavior was so abrupt and so
mysterious that Mrs. Norman felt that something must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
have happened to account for it. Somebody, she had
no doubt, had been talking. She was much annoyed
with Wilkinson in consequence, and, when she met him
accidentally in the High Street, her manner conveyed
to him her just resentment.</p>

<p>He called in Fitzjohn's Avenue the next Sunday.
For the first time he was without his wife.</p>

<p>He was so downcast, and so penitent, and so ashamed
of himself that Mrs. Norman met him halfway with a
little rush of affection.</p>

<p>"Why have you not been to see us all this time?"
she said.</p>

<p>He looked at her unsteadily; his whole manner betrayed
an extreme embarrassment.</p>

<p>"I've come," he said, "on purpose to explain. You
mustn't think I don't appreciate your kindness, but
the fact is my poor wife"&mdash;(She knew that woman was
at the bottom of it!)&mdash;"is no longer&mdash;up to it."</p>

<p>"What is the wretch up to, I should like to know?"
thought Mrs. Norman.</p>

<p>He held her with his melancholy, unsteady eyes. He
seemed to be endeavoring to approach a subject intimately
and yet abstrusely painful.</p>

<p>"She finds the music&mdash;just at present&mdash;a little too
much for her; the vibrations, you know. It's extraordinary
how they affect her. She feels them&mdash;most unpleasantly&mdash;just
here." Wilkinson laid two delicate
fingers on the middle buttons of his waistcoat.</p>

<p>Mrs. Norman was very kind to him. He was not
very expert, poor fellow, in the fabrication of excuses.
His look seemed to implore her pardon for the shifts
he had been driven to; it appealed to her to help him
out, to stand by him in his unspeakable situation.</p>

<p>"I see," she said.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>He smiled, in charming gratitude to her for seeing
it.</p>

<p>That smile raised the devil in her. Why, after all,
should she help him out?</p>

<p>"And are you susceptible to music&mdash;in the same
unpleasant way?"</p>

<p>"Me? Oh, no&mdash;no. I like it; it gives me the very
greatest pleasure." He stared at her in bewilderment
and distress.</p>

<p>"Then why," said Mrs. Norman sweetly, "if it gives
you pleasure, should you cut yourself off from it?"</p>

<p>"My dear Mrs. Norman, we have to cut ourselves
off from a great many things&mdash;that give us pleasure.
It can't be helped."</p>

<p>She meditated. "Would it be any good," she said,
"if I were to call on Mrs. Wilkinson?"</p>

<p>Wilkinson looked grave. "It is most kind of you,
but&mdash;just at present&mdash;I think it might be wiser not.
She really, you know, isn't very fit."</p>

<p>Mrs. Norman's silence neither accepted nor rejected
the preposterous pretext. Wilkinson went on, helping
himself out as best he could:</p>

<p>"I can't talk about it; but I thought I ought to let
you know. We've just got to give everything up."</p>

<p>She held herself in. A terrible impulse was upon
her to tell him straight out that she did not see it;
that it was too bad; that there was no reason why she
should be called upon to give everything up.</p>

<p>"So, if we don't come," he said, "you'll understand?
It's better&mdash;it really is better not."</p>

<p>His voice moved her, and her heart cried to him,
"Poor Peter!"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said; "I understand."</p>

<p>Of course she understood. Poor Peter! so it had
come to that?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>"Can't you stay for tea?" she said.</p>

<p>"No; I must be going back to her."</p>

<p>He rose. His hand found hers. Its slight pressure
told her that he gave and took the sadness of renunciation.</p>

<p>That winter Mrs. Wilkinson fell ill in good earnest,
and Wilkinson became the prey of a pitiful remorse
that kept him a prisoner by his wife's bedside.</p>

<p>He had always been a good man; it was now understood
that he avoided Mrs. Norman because he desired
to remain what he had always been.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>There was also an understanding, consecrated by
the piety of their renunciation, that Wilkinson was
only waiting for his wife's death to marry Mrs. Norman.</p>

<p>And Wilkinson's wife was a long time in dying. It
was not to be supposed that she would die quickly, as
long as she could interfere with his happiness by living.</p>

<p>With her genius for frustrating and tormenting, she
kept the poor man on tenter-hooks with perpetual relapses
and recoveries. She jerked him on the chain.
He was always a prisoner on the verge of his release.
She was at death's door in March. In April she was
to be seen, convalescent, in a bath-chair, being wheeled
slowly up and down the Spaniard's Road. And Wilkinson
walked by the chair, his shoulders bent, his
eyes fixed on the ground, his face set in an expression
of illimitable patience.</p>

<p>In the summer she gave it up and died; and in the
following spring Wilkinson resumed his converse with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
Mrs. Norman. All things considered, he had left a
decent interval.</p>

<p>By autumn Mrs. Norman's friends were all on tiptoe
and craning their necks with expectation. It was
assumed among them that Wilkinson would propose
to her the following summer, when the first year of
his widowhood should be ended. When summer came
there was nothing between them that anybody could
see. But it by no means followed that there was
nothing to be seen. Mrs. Norman seemed perfectly
sure of him. In her intense sympathy for Wilkinson
she knew how to account for all his hesitations and
delays. She could not look for any passionate, decisive
step from the broken creature he had become;
she was prepared to accept him as he was, with all his
humiliating fears and waverings. The tragic things
his wife had done to him could not be undone in a
day.</p>

<p>Another year divided Wilkinson from his tragedy,
and still he stood trembling weakly on the verge. Mrs.
Norman began to grow thin. She lost her bright air
of defiance, and showed herself vulnerable by the hand
of time. And nothing, positively nothing, stood between
them, except Wilkinson's morbid diffidence. So
absurdly manifest was their case that somebody (the
Troubadour man, in fact) interposed discreetly. In
the most delicate manner possible, he gave Wilkinson
to understand that he would not necessarily make
himself obnoxious to Mrs. Norman were he to approach
her with&mdash;well, with a view to securing their joint happiness&mdash;happiness
which they had both earned by their
admirable behavior.</p>

<p>That was all that was needed: a tactful friend of
both parties to put it to Wilkinson simply and in the
right way. Wilkinson rose from his abasement. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
was a light in his eye that rejoiced the tactful friend;
his face had a look of sudden, virile determination.</p>

<p>"I will go to her," he said, "now."</p>

<p>It was a dark, unpleasant evening, full of cold and
sleet.</p>

<p>Wilkinson thrust his arms into an overcoat, jammed
a cap down on his forehead, and strode into the
weather. He strode into Mrs. Norman's drawing-room.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Norman saw that look on his face she
knew that it was all right. Her youth rose in her
again to meet it.</p>

<p>"Forgive me," said Wilkinson. "I had to come."</p>

<p>"Why not?" she said.</p>

<p>"It's so late."</p>

<p>"Not too late for me."</p>

<p>He sat down, still with his air of determination, in
the chair she indicated. He waved away, with unconcealed
impatience, the trivialities she used to soften
the violence of his invasion.</p>

<p>"I've come," he said, "because I've had something
on my mind. It strikes me that I've never really
thanked you."</p>

<p>"Thanked me?"</p>

<p>"For your great kindness to my wife."</p>

<p>Mrs. Norman looked away.</p>

<p>"I shall always be grateful to you," said Wilkinson.
"You were very good to her."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no," she moaned.</p>

<p>"I assure you," he insisted, "she felt it very much.
I thought you would like to know that."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes." Mrs. Norman's voice went very low with
the sinking of her heart.</p>

<p>"She used to say you did more for her&mdash;you and
your sister, with her beautiful music&mdash;than all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
doctors. You found the thing that eased her. I suppose
<i>you</i> knew how ill she was&mdash;all the time? I mean
before her last illness."</p>

<p>"I don't think," said she, "I did know."</p>

<p>His face, which had grown grave, brightened. "No?
Well, you see, she was so plucky. Nobody could have
known; I didn't always realize it myself."</p>

<p>Then he told her that for five years his wife had
suffered from a nervous malady that made her subject
to strange excitements and depressions.</p>

<p>"We fought it," he said, "together. Through it all,
even on her worst days, she was always the same to
me."</p>

<p>He sank deeper into memory.</p>

<p>"Nobody knows what she was to me. She wasn't
one much for society. She went into it" (his manner
implied that she had adorned it) "to please me, because
I thought it might do her good. It was one of
the things we tried."</p>

<p>Mrs. Norman stared at him. She stared through
him and beyond him, and saw a strange man. She
listened to a strange voice that sounded far off, from
somewhere beyond forgetfulness.</p>

<p>"There were times," she heard him saying, "when
we could not go out or see anyone. All we wanted
was to be alone together. We could sit, she and I, a
whole evening without saying a word. We each knew
what the other wanted to say without saying it. I was
always sure of her; she understood me as nobody else
ever can." He paused. "All that's gone."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," Mrs. Norman said, "it isn't."</p>

<p>"It is." He illuminated himself with a faint flame
of passion.</p>

<p>"Don't say that, when you have friends who understand."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>"They don't. They can't. And," said Wilkinson, "I
don't want them to."</p>

<p>Mrs. Norman sat silent, as in the presence of something
sacred and supreme.</p>

<p>She confessed afterward that what had attracted her
to Peter Wilkinson was his tremendous capacity for
devotion. Only (this she did not confess) she never
dreamed that it had been given to his wife.</p>

<hr class="w25" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>She had arrived.</p>

<p>Fanny Brocklebank, as she passed the library, had
thought it worth while to look in upon Straker with
the news.</p>

<p>Straker could not help suspecting his hostess of an
iniquitous desire to see how he would take it. Or perhaps
she may have meant, in her exquisite benevolence,
to prepare him. Balanced on the arm of the
opposite chair, the humor of her candid eyes chastened
by what he took to be a remorseful pity, she had the
air of preparing him for something.</p>

<p>Yes. She had arrived. She was upstairs, over his
very head&mdash;resting.</p>

<p>Straker screwed up his eyes. Only by a prodigious
effort could he see Miss Tarrant resting. He had
always thought of her as an unwinking, untiring splendor,
an imperishable fascination; he had shrunk from
inquiring by what mortal process she renewed her formidable
flame.</p>

<p>By a gesture of shoulders and of eyebrows Fanny
conveyed that, whatever he thought of Philippa Tarrant,
she was more so than ever. She&mdash;she was simply
stupendous. It was Fanny's word. He would see.
She would appear at teatime. If he was on the terrace
by five he would see something worth seeing. It
was now a quarter to.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>He gathered that Fanny had only looked in to tell
him that he mustn't miss it.</p>

<p>Not for worlds would he have missed it. But the
clock had struck five, and Straker was still lingering in
the library over the correspondence that will pursue
a rising barrister in his flight to the country. He wasn't
in a hurry. He knew that Miss Tarrant would wait
for her moment, and he waited too.</p>

<p>A smile of acclamation greeted his dilatory entrance
on the terrace. He was assured that, though late, he
was still in time. He knew it. She would not appear
until the last guest had settled peaceably into his place,
until the scene was clear for her stunning, her invincible
effect. Then, in some moment of pause, of expectancy&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Odd that Straker, who was so used to it, who knew
so well how she would do it, should feel so fresh an
interest in seeing her do it again. It was almost as
if he trembled for her and waited, wondering whether,
this time, she would fail of her effect, whether he
would ever live to see her disconcerted.</p>

<p>Disconcerting things had happened before now at
the Brocklebanks', things incongruous with the ancient
peace, the dignity, the grand style of Amberley. It
was owing to the outrageous carelessness with which
Fanny Brocklebank mixed her house parties. She delighted
in daring combinations and startling contrasts.
Straker was not at all sure that he himself had not been
chosen as an element in a daring combination. Fanny
could hardly have forgotten that, two years ago, he
had been an adorer (not altogether prostrate) of Miss
Tarrant, and he had given her no grounds for supposing
that he had changed his attitude. In the absence
of authentic information Fanny could only suppose
that he had been dished, regularly dished, first by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
young Reggy Lawson and then by Mr. Higginson. It
was for Mr. Higginson that Philippa was coming to
Amberley&mdash;this year; last year it had been for Reggy
Lawson; the year before that it had been for him,
Straker. And Fanny did not scruple to ask them all
three to meet one another. That was her way. Some
day she would carry it too far. Straker, making his
dilatory entrance, became aware of the distance to
which his hostess had carried it already. It had time
to grow on him, from wonder to the extreme of certainty,
in his passage down the terrace to the southwest
corner. There, on the outskirts of the group, brilliantly
and conspicuously disposed, in postures of intimate
communion, were young Laurence Furnival and
Mrs. Viveash. Straker knew and Fanny knew, nobody
indeed knew better than Fanny, that those two ought
never to have been asked together. In strict propriety
they ought not to have been at Amberley at all. Nobody
but Fanny would have dreamed of asking them,
still less of combining them with old Lady Paignton,
who was propriety itself. And there was Miss Probyn.
Why Miss Probyn? What on earth did dear Fanny
imagine that she could do with Mary Probyn&mdash;or for
her, if it came to that? In Straker's experience of
Fanny it generally did come to that&mdash;to her doing
things for people. He was aware, most acutely aware
at this moment, of what, two years ago, she would have
done for him. He had an idea that even now, at this
hour, she was giving him his chance with Philippa.
There would no doubt be competition; there always
had been, always would be competition; but her charming
eyes seemed to assure him that he should have his
chance.</p>

<p>They called him to her side, where, with a movement
of protection that was not lost on him, she had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
made a place for him apart. She begged him just to
look at young Reggy Lawson, who sat in agony, sustaining
a ponderous topic with Miss Probyn. He remembered
Reggy? Her half-remorseful smile implied
that he had good cause to remember him. He did.
He was sorry for young Reggy, and hoped that he
found consolation in the thought that Mr. Higginson
was no longer young.</p>

<p>He remarked that Reggy was looking uncommonly
fit. "So," he added irrelevantly, "is Mrs. Viveash.
Don't you think?"</p>

<p>Fanny Brocklebank looked at Mrs. Viveash. It was
obvious that she was giving her her chance, and that
Mrs. Viveash was making the very most of it. She
was leaning forward now, with her face thrust out toward
Furnival; and on her face and on her mouth and
in her eyes there burned visibly, flagrantly, the ungovernable,
inextinguishable flame. As for the young man,
while his eyes covered and caressed her, the tilt of his
body, of his head, of his smile, and all his features expressed
the insolence of possession. He was sure of
her; he was sure of himself; he was sure of many
things. He, at any rate, would never be disconcerted.
Whatever happened he was safe. But she&mdash;there were
things that, if one thing happened, she would have to
face; and as she sat there, wrapped in her flame, she
seemed to face them, to fling herself on the front of
danger. You could see she was ready to take any risks,
to pay any price for the chance that Fanny was giving
her.</p>

<p>It really was too bad of Fanny.</p>

<p>"Why did you ask them?" Straker had known Fanny
so long that he was privileged to inquire.</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;they wanted to be asked."</p>

<p>Fanny believed, and said that she believed, in giving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
people what they wanted. As for the consequences,
there was no mortal lapse or aberration that could trouble
her serenity or bring a blush to her enduring candor.
If you came a cropper you might be sure that
Fanny's judgment of you would be pure from the superstition
of morality. She herself had never swerved
in affection or fidelity to Will Brocklebank. She took
her excitements, lawful or otherwise, vicariously in the
doomed and dedicated persons of her friends. Brocklebank
knew it. Blond, spectacled, middle-aged, and
ponderous, he regarded his wife's performances and
other people's with a leniency as amazing as her own.
He was hovering about old Lady Paignton in the background,
where Straker could see his benignant gaze
resting on Furnival and Mrs. Viveash.</p>

<p>"Poor dears," said Fanny, as if in extenuation of
her tolerance, "they <i>are</i> enjoying themselves."</p>

<p>"So are you," said Straker.</p>

<p>"I like to see other people happy. Don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. If I'm not responsible for their&mdash;happiness."</p>

<p>"Who <i>is</i> responsible?" She challenged.</p>

<p>"I say, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Me responsible? Have you seen her husband?"</p>

<p>"I have."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;&mdash;" she left it to him.</p>

<p>"Where <i>is</i> Viveash?"</p>

<p>"At the moment he is in Liverpool, or should be&mdash;on
business."</p>

<p>"You didn't ask him?"</p>

<p>"Ask him? Is he the sort you can ask?"</p>

<p>"Oh, come, he's not so bad."</p>

<p>"He's awful. He's impossible. He&mdash;he excuses
everything."</p>

<p>"I don't see him excusing this, or your share in it.
If he knew."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>"If he knew what?"</p>

<p>"That you'd asked Furny down."</p>

<p>"But he doesn't know. He needn't ever know."</p>

<p>"He needn't. But people like Viveash have a perfect
genius for the unnecessary. Besides&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused before the unutterable, and she faced him
with her smile of innocent interrogation.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "it's so jolly risky. These things,
you know, only end one way."</p>

<p>Fanny's eyes said plainly that to <i>their</i> vision all sorts
of ways were possible.</p>

<p>"If it were any other man but&mdash;&mdash;" He stopped
short at Furnival's name.</p>

<p>Fanny lowered her eyes almost as if she had been
convicted of indiscretion.</p>

<p>"You see," she said, "any other man wouldn't do.
He's the one and only man. There never was any
other. That's the awful part of it for her."</p>

<p>"Then why on earth did she marry the other fellow?"</p>

<p>"Because Furny couldn't marry her. And he
wouldn't, either. That's not his way."</p>

<p>"I know it's not his way. And if Viveash took steps,
what then?"</p>

<p>"Then perhaps&mdash;he'd have to."</p>

<p>"Good Lord&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, it isn't a deep-laid plan."</p>

<p>"I never said it was."</p>

<p>He didn't think it. Marriages had been made at
Amberley, and divorces, too; not by any plan of
Fanny's, but by the risks she took. Seeing the dangerous
way she mixed things, he didn't, he couldn't suspect
her of a plan, but he did suspect her of an unholy
joy in the prospect of possible explosions.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course," she said, reverting to her vision, "of
course he'd have to."</p>

<p>She looked at Straker with eyes where mischief
danced a fling. It was clear that in that moment she
saw Laurence Furnival the profane, Furnival the
scorner of marriage, caught and tied: punished (she
scented in ecstasy the delicate irony of it), so beautifully
punished there where he had sinned.</p>

<p>Straker began to have some idea of the amusement
Fanny got out of her house parties.</p>

<p>For a moment they had no more to say. All around
them there was silence, born of Mrs. Viveash and her
brooding, of young Reggy's trouble with Miss Probyn,
and of some queer triangular complication in the converse
of Brocklebank, Lady Paignton, and Mr. Higginson.
In that moment and that pause Straker
thought again of Miss Tarrant. It was, he said to himself,
the pause and the moment for her appearance.
And (so right was he in his calculation) she appeared.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>He saw her standing in the great doorway of the east
wing where the three steps led down on to the terrace.
She stood on the topmost step, poised for her descent,
shaking her scarf loose to drift in a white mist about
her. Then she came down the terrace very slowly, and
the measured sweep of her limbs suggested that all her
movements would be accomplished to a large rhythm
and with a superb delay.</p>

<p>Her effect (she had not missed it) was to be seen in
all its wonder and perfection on Laurence Furnival's
face. Averted suddenly from Mrs. Viveash, Furnival's
face expressed the violence of his shock and his excitement.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
It was clear that he had never seen anything
quite like Philippa Tarrant before, and that he found
her incredibly and ambiguously interesting. Ambiguously&mdash;no
other word did justice to the complexity of
his facial expression. He did not know all at once what
to make of Philippa, and, from further and more furtive
manifestations of Furnival's, Straker gathered that
the young man was making something queer. He had
a sort of sympathy with him, for there had been moments
when he himself had not known exactly what
to make. He doubted whether even Fanny Brocklebank
(who certainly made the best of her) had ever
really known.</p>

<p>Whatever her inscrutable quality, this year she was,
as Fanny had said, more so than ever. She <i>was</i> stupendous;
and that although she was not strictly speaking
beautiful. She had no color in her white face or
in her black hair; she had no color but the morbid
rose of her mouth and the brown of her eyes. Yet Mrs.
Viveash, with all her vivid gold and carmine, went out
before her; so did pretty Fanny, though fresh as paint
and burnished to perfection; as for the other women,
they were nowhere. She made the long golden terrace
at Amberley a desert place for the illusion of her somber
and solitary beauty. She was warm-fleshed, warm-blooded.
The sunshine soaked into her as she stood
there. What was more, she had the air of being entirely
in keeping with Amberley's grand style.</p>

<p>Straker saw that from the first she was aware of Furnival.
At three yards off she held him with her eyes,
lightly, balancing him; then suddenly she let him go.
She ceased to be aware of him. In the moment of introduction
she turned from him to Straker.</p>

<p>"Mr. Straker&mdash;but&mdash;how delightful!"</p>

<p>"Don't say you didn't expect to see me here."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>"I didn't. And Mr. Higginson!" She laughed at
the positive absurdity of it. "<i>And</i> Mr. Lawson and
Miss Probyn."</p>

<p>She held herself a little back and gazed upon the
group with her wide and wonderful eyes.</p>

<p>"You look," she said, "as if something interesting
had happened."</p>

<p>She had seated herself beside Straker so that she
faced Mrs. Viveash and young Furnival. She appeared
not to know that Furnival was staring at her.</p>

<p>"<i>She's</i> the only interesting thing that's happened&mdash;so
far," he muttered. (There was no abatement of his
stare.) Mrs. Viveash tried to look as if she agreed
with him.</p>

<p>Miss Tarrant had heard him. Her eyes captured and
held him again, a little longer this time. Straker, who
watched the two, saw that something passed between
them, between Philippa's gaze and Furnival's stare.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>That evening he realized completely what Fanny
had meant when she said that Philippa was more so
than ever. He observed this increase in her quality,
not only in the broad, massive impression that she
spread, but in everything about her, her gestures, her
phrases, the details of her dress. Every turn of her
head and of her body displayed a higher flamboyance,
a richer audacity, a larger volume of intention. He
was almost afraid for her lest she should overdo it by
a shade, a touch, a turn. You couldn't get away from
her. The drawing-room at Amberley was filled with
her, filled with white surfaces of neck and shoulders,
with eyes somber yet aflood with light, eyes that were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
perpetually at work upon you and perpetually at play,
that only rested for a moment to accentuate their
movement and their play. This effect of her was as of
many women, approaching, withdrawing, and sliding
again into view, till you were aware with a sort of
shock that it was one woman, Philippa Tarrant, all
the time, and that all the play and all the movement
were concentrated on one man, Laurence Furnival.</p>

<p>She never let him alone for a minute. He tried, to
do him justice he tried&mdash;Straker saw him trying&mdash;to
escape. But, owing to Miss Tarrant's multiplicity and
omnipresence, he hadn't a chance. You saw him fascinated,
stupefied by the confusion and the mystery of
it. She carried him off under Mrs. Viveash's unhappy
nose. Wherever she went she called him, and he followed,
flushed and shamefaced. He showed himself
now pitifully abject, and now in pitiful revolt. Once
or twice he was positively rude to her, and Miss Tarrant
seemed to enjoy that more than anything.</p>

<p>Straker had never seen Philippa so uplifted. She
went like the creature of an inspiring passion, a passion
moment by moment fulfilled and unappeased,
renascent, reminiscent, and in all its moments gloriously
aware of itself.</p>

<p>The pageant of Furnival's subjugation lasted through
the whole of Friday evening. All Saturday she ignored
him and her work on him. You would have said it had
been undertaken on Mrs. Viveash's account, not his,
just to keep Mrs. Viveash in her place and show her
what she, Philippa, could do. All Sunday, by way of
revenge, Furnival ignored Miss Tarrant, and consoled
himself flagrantly with Mrs. Viveash.</p>

<p>It was on the afternoon of Sunday that Mr. Higginson
was seen sitting out on the terrace with Miss Tarrant.
Reggy Lawson had joined them, having extricated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
himself with some dexterity from the toils of
the various ladies who desired to talk to him. His
attitude suggested that he was taking his dubious
chance against Mr. Higginson. It was odd that it
should be dubious, Reggy's chance; he himself was
so assured, so engaging in his youth and physical perfection.
Straker would have backed him against any
man he knew.</p>

<p>Fanny Brocklebank had sent Straker out into the
rose garden with Mary Probyn. He left Miss Tarrant
on the terrace alone with Mr. Higginson and Reggy.
He left her talking to Mr. Higginson, listening to Mr.
Higginson, behaving beautifully to Mr. Higginson, and
ignoring Reggy. Straker, with Mary Probyn, walked
round and round the rose garden, which was below
Miss Tarrant's end of the terrace, and while he talked
to Mary Probyn he counted the rounds. There were
twenty to the mile. Every time he turned he had Miss
Tarrant full in view, which distracted him from Mary
Probyn. Mary didn't seem to mind. She was a nice
woman; plain (in a nice, refined sort of way), and she
knew it, and was nice to you whether you talked to her
or not. He did not find it difficult to talk to Mary:
she was interested in Miss Tarrant; she admired her,
but not uncritically.</p>

<p>"She is the least bit too deliberate," was her comment.
"She calculates her effects."</p>

<p>"She does," said Straker, "so that she never misses
one of them. She's a consummate artist."</p>

<p>He had always thought her <i>that</i>. (Ninth round.)
But as her friend he could have wished her a freer and
sincerer inspiration. After all, there <i>was</i> something
that she missed.</p>

<p>(Tenth round.) Miss Tarrant was still behaving
beautifully to Mr. Higginson. Mary Probyn marveled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
to see them getting on so well together. (Fifteenth
round.)</p>

<p>Reggy had left them; they were not getting on together
quite so well.</p>

<p>(Twentieth round.) They had risen; they were
coming down the steps into the garden; Straker heard
Miss Tarrant ordering Mr. Higginson to go and talk
to Miss Probyn. He did so with an alacrity which
betrayed a certain fear of the lady he admired.</p>

<p>Miss Tarrant, alone with Straker, turned on him the
face which had scared Mr. Higginson. She led him in
silence and at a rapid pace down through the rose
garden and out upon the lawn beyond. There she
stood still and drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>"You had no business," she said, "to go away like
that and leave me with him."</p>

<p>"Why not? Last year, if I remember&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused. He remembered perfectly that last year
she had contrived pretty often to be left with him.
Last year Mr. Higginson, as the Liberal candidate for
East Mickleham, seemed about to achieve a distinction,
which, owing to his defeat by an overwhelming majority,
he had unfortunately not achieved. He had
not been prudent. He had stood, not only for East
Mickleham, but for a principle. It was an unpopular
principle, and he knew it, and he had stuck to it all
the same, with obstinacy and absurdity, in the teeth,
the furiously gnashing teeth, of his constituency. You
couldn't detach Mr. Higginson from his principle, and
as long as he stuck to it a parliamentary career was
closed to him. It was sad, for he had a passion for
politics; he had chosen politics as the one field for the
one ponderous talent he possessed. The glory of it
had hung ponderously about Mr. Higginson last year;
but this year, cut off from politics, it was pitiable, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
nonentity he had become. Straker could read that in
his lady's alienated eyes.</p>

<p>"Last year," he continued, "you seemed to find him
interesting."</p>

<p>"You think things must be what they seem?"</p>

<p>Her tone accused him of insufficient metaphysical
acumen.</p>

<p>"There is no necessity. Still, as I said, last year&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Could Mr. Higginson, in any year, be interesting?"</p>

<p>"Did you hope," Straker retorted, "to make him so
by cultivating him?"</p>

<p>"It's impossible to say what Mr. Higginson might
become under&mdash;centuries of cultivation. It would take
centuries."</p>

<p>That was all very well, he said to himself. If he
didn't say that Miss Tarrant had pursued Mr. Higginson,
he distinctly recalled the grace with which she
had allowed herself to be pursued. She <i>had</i> cultivated
him. And, having done it, having so flagrantly and
palpably and under Straker's own eyes gone in for
him, how on earth did she propose to get out of it
now? There was, Straker said to himself again, no
getting out of it. As for centuries&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let us go back," he persisted, "to last year."</p>

<p>"Last year he had his uses. He was a good watch-dog."</p>

<p>"A <i>what</i>?"</p>

<p>"A watch-dog. He kept other people off."</p>

<p>For a moment he was disarmed by the sheer impudence
of it. He smiled a reminiscent smile.</p>

<p>"I should have thought his function was rather,
wasn't it, to draw them on?"</p>

<p>Her triumphing eyes showed him that he had given
himself into her hands. He should have been content
with his reminiscent smile. Wasn't he, her eyes inquired,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
for a distinguished barrister, just a little bit
too crude?</p>

<p>"You thought," she said, "he was a decoy-duck?
Why, wouldn't you have flown from your most adored
if you'd seen her&mdash;with Mr. Higginson?"</p>

<p>Thus deftly she wove her web and wound him into
it. That was her way. She would take your own
words out of your mouth and work them into the brilliant
fabric, tangling you in your talk. And not only
did she tangle you in your talk, she confused you in
your mental processes.</p>

<p>"You didn't seriously suppose," she said, "that I
could have had any permanent use for him?"</p>

<p>Straker's smile paid tribute to her crowning cleverness.
He didn't know how much permanence she attached
to matrimony, or to Mr. Higginson, but he
knew that she had considered him in that preposterous
relation. She faced him and his awful knowledge and
floored him with just that&mdash;the thing's inherent, palpable
absurdity. And if <i>that</i> wasn't clever of her!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Of course not." He was eager in his assent; it was
wrung from him. He added with apparent irrelevance,
"After all, he's honest."</p>

<p>"You must be something."</p>

<p>She turned to him, radiant and terrible, rejoicing
in her murderous phrase. It intimated that only by
his honesty did Mr. Higginson maintain his foothold
on existence.</p>

<p>"I think," said Straker, "it's time to dress for dinner."</p>

<p>They turned and went slowly toward the house. On
the terrace, watch in hand, Mr. Higginson stood alone
and conspicuous, shining in his single attribute of
honesty.</p>

<p>That evening Furnival sought Straker out in a lonely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
corner of the smoke-room. His face was flushed and
defiant. He put it to Straker point-blank.</p>

<p>"I say, what's she up to, that friend of yours, Miss
T-Tarrant?"</p>

<p>He stammered over her name. Her name excited
him.</p>

<p>Straker intimated that it was not given him to know
what Miss Tarrant might or might not be up to.</p>

<p>Furnival shook his head. "I can't make her out.
Upon my honor, I can't."</p>

<p>Straker wondered what Furny's honor had to do
with it.</p>

<p>"Why is she hanging round like this?"</p>

<p>"Hanging round?"</p>

<p>"Yes. You know what I mean. Why doesn't somebody
marry her?" He made a queer sound in his
throat, a sound of unspeakable interrogation. "Why
haven't you married her yourself?"</p>

<p>Straker was loyal. "You'd better ask her why she
hasn't married me."</p>

<p>Furnival brooded. "I've a good mind to."</p>

<p>"I should if I were you," said Straker encouragingly.</p>

<p>Furnival sighed heavily. "Look here," he said,
"what's the matter with her? Is she difficult, or
what?"</p>

<p>"Frightfully difficult," said Straker, with conviction.
His tone implied that Furnival would never understand
her, that he hadn't the brain for it.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>And yet, Straker reminded himself, Furnival wasn't
an ass. He had brain for other things, for other
women; for poor Nora Viveash quite a remarkable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
sufficiency of brain, but not for Philippa Tarrant.
You could see how he was being driven by her. He
was in that state when he would have done anything
to get her. There was no folly and no extravagance
that he would not commit. And yet, driven as he
was, it was clear that he resented being driven, that
he was not going all the way. His kicking, his frantic
dashes and plunges, showed that the one extravagance,
the one folly he would not commit was matrimony.</p>

<p>Straker saw that very plainly. He wondered
whether Miss Tarrant would see it, too, and if she did
whether it would make any difference in her method.</p>

<p>It was very clear to Straker that Miss Tarrant was
considering Furnival, as she had considered him, as
she had considered young Reggy Lawson, as she had
considered Mr. Higginson, who was not so young. As
for Reggy and his successor, she had done with them.
All that could be known of their fatuity she knew.
Perhaps they had never greatly interested her. But
she was interested in Laurence Furnival. She told
Straker that he was the most amusing man of her acquaintance.
She was, Straker noticed, perpetually
aware of him. All Monday morning, in the motor,
Miss Tarrant in front with Brocklebank, Furnival
with Mrs. Viveash, and Straker behind, it was an
incessant duel between Furnival's eyes and the eyes
that Miss Tarrant had in the back of her head. All
Monday afternoon she had him at her heels, at her
elbow. With every gesture she seemed to point to him
and say: "Look at this little animal I've caught. Did
you ever see such an amusing little animal?"</p>

<p>She was quite aware that it was an animal, the
creature she had captured and compelled to follow
her; it might hide itself now and then, but it never
failed to leap madly forward at her call. The animal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
in Furnival, so simple, so undisguised, and so spontaneous,
was what amused her.</p>

<p>Its behavior that Monday after tea on the terrace
was one of the most disconcerting things that had
occurred at Amberley. You could see that Mrs. Viveash
couldn't bear it, that she kept looking away,
that Brocklebank didn't know where to look, and that
even Fanny was perturbed.</p>

<p>As for Mr. Higginson, it was altogether too much for
him and his honesty. He was visibly alienated, and
from that moment he devoted himself and his honesty
to Mary Probyn.</p>

<p>Young Reggy was alienated, too, so profoundly that
he spoke about it aside to Straker.</p>

<p>"Between you and me," said young Reggy, "it's a
bit too strong. I can't stick it, the way she goes on.
What does she <i>mean</i> by it, Straker?"</p>

<p>People were always appealing to Straker to tell them
what women meant by it. As if he knew.</p>

<p>He was glad to see that young Reggy had turned,
that he <i>could</i> turn. He liked Reggy, and he felt that
he owed him a good deal. If it had not been for Reggy
he might, two years ago, have been numbered as one
of the fallen. He had been pretty far gone two years
ago, so far that he had frequently wondered how it
was that he had not fallen. Now it was clear to him.
It had been her method with Reggy that had checked
his own perilous approaches. It had offended his fine
sense of the fitting (a fastidiousness which, in one of
her moods of ungovernable frankness, she had qualified
as "finicking"). For Reggy was a nice boy, and her
method had somehow resulted in making him appear
not so nice. It nourished and brought to the surface
that secret, indecorous, primordial quality that he
shared, though in less splendor and abundance, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
Laurence Furnival. He had kept his head, or had
seemed inimitably to have kept it. At any rate, he
had preserved his sense of decency. He was incapable
of presenting on the terrace at Amberley the flaming
pageant of his passion. Straker was not sure how far
this restraint, this level-headedness of young Reggy,
had been his undoing. It might be that Miss Tarrant
had required of him a pageant. Anyhow, Reggy's
case had been very enlightening to Straker.</p>

<p>And it was through Reggy, or rather through his
own intent and breathless observation of the two, that
Straker had received his final illumination. It had
come suddenly in one inspiring and delivering flash;
he could recall even now his subsequent sensations, the
thrilling lucidity of soul, the prodigious swiftness of
body, after his long groping in obscurities and mysteries.
For it had been a mystery to him how she had
resisted Reggy in his young physical perfection and
with the charm he had, a charm that spiritualized him,
a charm that should have appealed to everything that
was supersensuous in Philippa Tarrant (and Philippa
would have had you believe that there was very little
in her that was not). It was incomprehensible therefore
to Straker how any woman who had a perfect
body, with a perfect heart in it, could have resisted
Reggy at his best&mdash;and for Mr. Higginson.</p>

<p>To be sure, compared with Mr. Higginson he was
impecunious; but that, to Straker's mind, was just
what gave him, with the other things, his indomitable
distinction. Reggy's distinction stood straight and
clean, naked of all accessories. An impecuniousness so
unexpressed, so delicate, so patrician could never have
weighed with Philippa against Reggy's charm. That
she should deliberately have reckoned up his income,
compared it with Mr. Higginson's, and deducted Reggy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
with the result was inconceivable. Whatever Straker
had thought of her he had never thought of her as
mercenary. It wasn't that. He had found out what
it was. Watching her at play with Reggy's fire (for
to the inconspicuous observer the young man had
flamed sufficiently), it had struck Straker that she
herself was flameless.</p>

<p>It was in the nature of Reggy's perfection that it
called, it clamored for response. And Philippa had not
responded. She hadn't got it in her to respond.</p>

<p>All this came back vividly to Straker as he watched
her now on the terrace, at play with the fiercer conflagration
that was Laurence Furnival.</p>

<p>She was cold; she had never kindled, never would,
never could kindle. Her eyes did, if you like; they
couldn't help it&mdash;God made them lights and flames&mdash;but
her mouth <i>couldn't</i>. To Straker in his illumination
all the meaning of Philippa Tarrant was in her
mouth. The small, exquisite thing lacked fulness and
the vivid rose that should have been the flowering of
her face. A certain tightness at the corners gave it an
indescribable expression of secrecy and mystery and
restraint. He saw in it the almost monstrous denial
and mockery of desire. He could not see it, as he had
seen Nora Viveash's mouth, curved forward, eager,
shedding flame at the brim, giving itself to lips that
longed for it. Philippa's mouth was a flower that
opened only at the touch, the thrill of her own gorgeous
egoism. He read in it the triumph of Philippa over
the flesh and blood of her race. She had nothing in her
of the dead. That was the wonder of her. The passion
of the dead had built up her body to the semblance
and the promise of their own delight; their desire,
long forgotten, rose again, lightening and darkening
in her amazing eyes; the imperishable instinct that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
impelled them to clothe her in their flesh and blood
survived in her, transfigured in strange impulses and
intuitions, but she herself left unfulfilled their promise
and their desire.</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;that was what her mouth meant; it was treacherous;
it betrayed the promise of her body and her
eyes. And Furnival was feeding his infatuation on the
meanings of her eyes and of her body&mdash;meanings that
were unmistakable to Straker.</p>

<p>As if she had known what the older man was thinking
of her, Philippa rose abruptly and turned her back
on Furnival and began to make violent love to old
Lady Paignton. Her eyes challenged Straker's across
the terrace. They said: "Look at me. I will be as
beautiful for this old lady as for any male thing on
earth. More beautiful. Have I ever set my cap so
becomingly at any of you as I am setting it now at her?
Have you ever seen finer eyes than these that I make
at her, that I lavish on her out of the sheer exuberance
of my nature? Very well, then; doesn't that prove
that you're wrong in all things you've been thinking
about me. <i>I</i> know what you've been thinking!"</p>

<p>As if she knew what he was thinking she made herself
beautiful for him. She allowed him presently to
take her for a walk, for quite a long walk. The woods
of Amberley lured them, westward, across the shining
fields. They went, therefore, through the woods and
back by the village in the cool of the evening.</p>

<p>He had seldom, he might say he had never, seen
Philippa in so agreeable a mood. She had sunk her
sex. She was tired of her terrible game, the game that
Straker saw through; she was playing another one, a
secret, innocent, delightful game. She laid herself out
to amuse Straker, instead of laying <i>him</i> out (as he put
it), on the table, to amuse herself.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>"Philippa," he said, "you've been adorable for the
last half hour."</p>

<p>"For the last half hour I've been myself."</p>

<p>She smiled as if to herself, a secret, meditative smile.
The mystery of it was not lost on Straker.</p>

<p>"I can always be myself," she said, "when I'm with
you."</p>

<p>"For half an hour," he murmured.</p>

<p>She went on. "You're not tiresome, like the others.
I don't know what there is about you, but you don't
bore me."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not&mdash;for half an hour."</p>

<p>"Not for millions of half hours."</p>

<p>"Consecutive?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes."</p>

<p>She tilted her head back and gazed at him with eyes
narrowed and slanting under their deep lids.</p>

<p>"Not in an immortality," she said.</p>

<p>She laughed aloud her joyous appreciation of him.</p>

<p>Straker was neither uplifted nor alarmed. He knew
exactly where he stood with her. She was not considering
him; she was not trying to get at him; she was
aware of his illumination and his disenchantment; she
was also aware of his continuous interest in her, and it
was his continuous interest, the study that he made of
her, that interested Philippa. She was anxious that
he should get her right, that he should accept her rendering
of herself. She knew at each moment what he
was thinking of her, and the thing that went on between
them was not a game&mdash;it was a duel, an amicable
duel, between her lucidity and his. Philippa
respected his lucidity.</p>

<p>"All the same," said Straker, "I am not the most
amusing man you know. You don't find me exciting."</p>

<p>"No." She turned it over. "No; I don't find you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
at all exciting <i>or</i> very amusing. How is it, then, that
you don't bore me?"</p>

<p>"How can I say?"</p>

<p>"I think it is because you're so serious, because you
take me seriously."</p>

<p>"But I don't. Not for a moment. As for an immortality
of seriousness&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"At least," she said, "you would admit that possibly
I might have a soul. At any rate, you behave as if
you did."</p>

<p>He dodged it dexterously.</p>

<p>"That's where the immortality comes in, is it?"</p>

<p>"Of <i>course</i>," said Philippa.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>She went on amusing Straker all evening, and after
dinner she made him take her into the conservatory.</p>

<p>The conservatory at Amberley is built out fanwise
from the big west drawing-room on to the southwest
corner of the terrace; it is furnished as a convenient
lounge, and you sit there drinking coffee, and smoking,
and admiring Brocklebank's roses, which are the glory
of Amberley. And all among Brocklebank's roses they
came upon Furnival and Mrs. Viveash.</p>

<p>Among the roses she shimmered and flushed in a
gown of rose and silver. Among the roses she was
lovely, sitting there with Furnival. And Straker saw
that Miss Tarrant was aware of the loveliness of Mrs.
Viveash, and that her instinct woke in her.</p>

<p>She advanced, trailing behind her the long, diaphanous
web of her black gown. When she was well within
the range of Furnival's sensations she paused to smell
a rose, bending her body backward and sideward so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
that she showed to perfection the deep curved lines that
swept from her shoulders to her breasts, and from her
breasts downward to her hips. A large diamond star
hung as by an invisible thread upon her neck: it
pointed downward to the hollow of her breasts. There
was no beauty that she had that was not somehow
pointed to, insisted on, held forever under poor Furnival's
excited eyes.</p>

<p>But in a black gown, among roses, she showed disadvantageously
her dead whiteness and her morbid
rose. She was aware of that. Mrs. Viveash, glowing
among the roses, had made her aware.</p>

<p>"Why did we ever come here?" she inquired of
Straker. "These roses are horribly unbecoming to
me."</p>

<p>"Nothing is unbecoming to you, and you jolly well
know it," said Furnival.</p>

<p>She ignored it.</p>

<p>"Just look at their complexions. They oughtn't to
be allowed about."</p>

<p>She picked one and laid it against the dead-white
hollow of her breast, and curled her neck to look at it
there; then she shook her head at it in disapproval,
took it away, and held it out an inch from Furnival's
face. He recoiled slightly.</p>

<p>"It won't bite," she murmured. "It'll let you stroke
it." She stroked it herself, with fingers drawn tenderly,
caressingly, over petals smooth and cool as their own
skin. "I believe it can feel. I believe it likes it."</p>

<p>Furnival groaned. Straker heard him; so did Mrs.
Viveash. She stirred in her seat, causing a spray of
Dorothy Perkins to shake as if it indeed felt and shared
her terror. Miss Tarrant turned from Furnival and
laid her rose on Mrs. Viveash's shoulder, where it did
no wrong.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's yours," she said; "or a part of you."</p>

<p>Mrs. Viveash looked up at Furnival, and her face
flickered for a moment. Furnival did not see her face;
he was staring at Miss Tarrant.</p>

<p>"Ah," he cried, "how perfect! You and I'll have to
dry up, Straker, unless you can go one better than
that."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't dream," said Straker, "of trying to beat
Miss Tarrant at her own game."</p>

<p>"If you know what it is. I'm hanged if I do."</p>

<p>Furnival was tearing from its tree a Caroline Testout,
one of Brocklebank's choicest blooms. Miss Tarrant
cried out:</p>

<p>"Oh, stop him, somebody. They're Mr. Brocklebank's
roses."</p>

<p>"They ain't a part of Brockles," Furnival replied.</p>

<p>He approached her with Brocklebank's Caroline
Testout, and, with his own dangerous, his outrageous
fervor, "You say it f-f-feels," he stammered. "It's
what you want, then&mdash;something t-tender and living
about you. Not that s-scin-t-tillating thing you've
got there. It tires me to look at it." He closed his
eyes.</p>

<p>"You needn't look at it," she said.</p>

<p>"I can't help it. It's part of you. I believe it grows
there. It makes me look at it."</p>

<p>His words came shaken from him in short, savage
jerks. To Straker, to Mrs. Viveash, he appeared intolerable;
but he had ceased to care how he appeared
to anybody. He had ceased to know that they were
there. They turned from him as from something monstrous,
intolerable, indecent. Mrs. Viveash's hands
and mouth were quivering, and her eyes implored
Straker to take her away somewhere where she couldn't
see Furnival and Philippa Tarrant.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>He took her out on to the terrace. Miss Tarrant
looked after them.</p>

<p>"That rose belongs to Mrs. Viveash now," she said.
"You'd better go and take it to her."</p>

<p>Furnival flung the Caroline Testout on the floor.
He trod on the Caroline Testout. It was by accident,
but still he trod on it; so that he seemed much more
brutal than he was.</p>

<p>"It's very hot in here," said she. "I'm going on to
the terrace."</p>

<p>"Let's go down," said he, "into the garden. We can
talk there."</p>

<p>"You seem to be able to talk anywhere," said she.</p>

<p>"I have to," said Furnival.</p>

<p>She went out and walked slowly down the terrace to
the east end where Straker sheltered Mrs. Viveash.</p>

<p>Furnival followed her.</p>

<p>"Are you coming with me or are you not?" he insisted.
"I can't get you a minute to myself. Come out
of this, can't you? I want to talk to you."</p>

<p>"And I," said Miss Tarrant, "want to talk to Mrs.
Viveash."</p>

<p>"You don't. You want to tease her. Can't you
leave the poor woman alone for a minute? She's happy
there with Straker."</p>

<p>"I want to see how happy she is," said Miss Tarrant.</p>

<p>"For God's sake!" he cried. "Don't. It's my last
chance. I'm going to-morrow." Miss Tarrant continued
to walk like one who did not hear. "I may
never see you again. You'll go off somewhere. You'll
disappear. I can't trust you."</p>

<p>Suddenly she stood still.</p>

<p>"You are going to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Not," said Furnival, "if you'd like me to stay.
That's what I want to talk to you about. Let's go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
down into the east walk. It's dark there, and they
can't hear us."</p>

<p>"They have heard you. You'd better go back to
Mrs. Viveash."</p>

<p>His upper lip lifted mechanically, but he made no
sound. He stood for a moment staring at her, obstructing
her path. Then he turned.</p>

<p>"I shall go back to her," he said.</p>

<p>He strode to Mrs. Viveash and called her by her
name. His voice had a queer vibration that sounded
to Miss Tarrant like a cry.</p>

<p>"Nora&mdash;you'll come with me, won't you?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Viveash got up without a word and went with
him. Miss Tarrant, standing beside Straker on the
terrace, saw them go down together into the twilight
of the east walk between the yew hedges.</p>

<p>Philippa said something designed to distract Straker's
attention; and still, with an air of distracting
him, of sheltering her sad sister, Mrs. Viveash, she led
him back into the house.</p>

<p>Furnival returned five minutes later, more flushed
than ever and defiant.</p>

<p>That night Straker, going down the long corridor to
his bedroom, saw Fanny Brocklebank and Philippa in
front of him. They went slowly, Fanny's head leaning
a little toward Philippa's. Not a word of what Philippa
was saying reached Straker, but he saw her turn with
Fanny into Fanny's room. As he passed the door he
was aware of Fanny's voice raised in deprecation, and
of Philippa's, urgent, imperative; and he knew, as well
as if he had heard her, that Philippa was telling
Fanny about Furnival and Nora Viveash.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>It was as if nothing had happened that Philippa
came to him on the terrace the next morning (which
was a Tuesday) before breakfast. As if nothing had
happened, as if she had hardly met Furnival, as if she
were considering him for the first time, she began
cross-questioning Straker.</p>

<p>"You know everybody. Tell me about Laurence
Furnival. <i>Is</i> he any good?"</p>

<p>Straker replied that she had better inquire at the
Home Office, the scene of Furnival's industry.</p>

<p>Philippa waved the Home Office aside. "I mean,
will he ever <i>do</i> anything?"</p>

<p>"Ask Fanny Brocklebank."</p>

<p>He knew very well that she had asked her, that she
had got out of Fanny full particulars as to Furnival's
family and the probable amount of his income, and
that she had come to him as the source of a finer information.</p>

<p>"Fanny wouldn't know," said she.</p>

<p>"Then," said Straker, "ask Mrs. Viveash."</p>

<p>She turned on him a cold and steady gaze that rebuked
his utterance. How dare he, it said, how dare
he mention Mrs. Viveash in her presence?</p>

<p>She answered quietly: "There will hardly be time, I
think. Mrs. Viveash is going to-day."</p>

<p>Straker turned on her now, and his look expressed
a sort of alien and repugnant admiration. He wondered
how far she had gone, how much she had told,
by what intimations she had prevailed with Fanny
to get Mrs. Viveash out of the house. Mrs. Viveash,
to be sure, had only been invited for the week-end,
from the Friday to the Tuesday, but it had been understood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
that, if her husband prolonged his business in
Liverpool, she was to stay till his return. Viveash was
still in Liverpool&mdash;that had been known at Amberley
yesterday&mdash;and Mrs. Viveash had not been asked to
stay. It had been quite simple. Mrs. Viveash, not
having been asked to stay, would be obliged to go.</p>

<p>"And is Furnival going, too?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I believe not," said Philippa.</p>

<p>An hour later Mrs. Viveash joined them in the
avenue where he waited for Miss Tarrant, who had
proposed that he should walk with her to the village.</p>

<p>In the clear and cruel light of the morning Mrs.
Viveash showed him a blanched face and eyes that had
seen with miserable lucidity the end of illusion, the
end of passion, and now saw other things and were
afraid.</p>

<p>"You know I'm going?" she said.</p>

<p>Straker said that he was sorry to hear it; by which
he meant that he was sorry for Mrs. Viveash.</p>

<p>She began to talk to him of trifles, small occurrences
at Amberley, of the affair of Mr. Higginson and Miss
Probyn, and then, as by a natural transition, of Miss
Tarrant.</p>

<p>"Do you like Miss Tarrant?" she asked suddenly,
point-blank.</p>

<p>Straker jibbed. "Well, really&mdash;I&mdash;I haven't thought
about it."</p>

<p>He hadn't. He knew how he stood with her, how he
felt about her; but whether it amounted to liking or
not liking he had not yet inquired. But that instant
he perceived that he did not like her, and he lied.</p>

<p>"Of course I like her. Why shouldn't I?"</p>

<p>"Because"&mdash;she was very slow about it&mdash;"somehow
I should have said that you were not that sort."</p>

<p>Her light on him came halting, obscured, shivering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
with all the vibrations of her voice; but he could see
through it, down to the sources of her thinking, to
something secret, luminous, and profound&mdash;her light
on Philippa.</p>

<p>She was instantly aware of what she had let him see.</p>

<p>"Oh," she cried, "that was horrid of me. It was
feline."</p>

<p>"It was a little," he admitted.</p>

<p>"It's because I know she doesn't like me."</p>

<p>"Why not say at once it's because you don't like
her?"</p>

<p>Her eyes, full, lucid, charged with meaning, flashed
to him. She leaped at the chance he offered her to
be sincere.</p>

<p>"I don't," she said. "How can I?"</p>

<p>She talked again of trifles, to destroy all cohesion
between that utterance and her next.</p>

<p>"I say, I want you to do something for me. I want
you to look after Furny."</p>

<p>"To look after him?"</p>

<p>"To stand by him, if&mdash;if he has a bad time."</p>

<p>He promised her. And then Miss Tarrant claimed
him. She was in her mood of yesterday; but the
charm no longer worked on him; he did not find her
adorable that morning.</p>

<p>After a longish round they were overtaken by
Brocklebank in his motor-car. He and Furnival were
returning from the station after seeing Mrs. Viveash
off (Furny had had the decency to see her off).
Brocklebank gave a joyous shout and pulled up two
yards in front of them.</p>

<p>As they stood beside the car Straker noticed that
Furnival's face had a queer, mottled look, and that
the muscles of his jaw were set in an immobility of
which he could hardly have believed him capable.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
He was actually trying to look as if he didn't see Miss
Tarrant. And Miss Tarrant was looking straight at
him.</p>

<p>Brocklebank wanted to know if Miss Tarrant cared
for a run across the Hog's Back before luncheon.</p>

<p>Miss Tarrant did care&mdash;if Mr. Straker did.</p>

<p>Furnival had got down from his seat beside Brocklebank
and had opened the door of the car, ignoring
Straker. He had managed in his descent to preserve
his attitude of distance, so much so that Straker was
amazed to see him enter the car after Miss Tarrant
and take his, Straker's, place beside her. He accomplished
this maneuver in silence, and with an air so
withdrawn, so obscurely predestined, that he seemed
innocent of all offense. It was as if he had acted from
some malign compulsion of which he was unaware.</p>

<p>Now Brocklebank in his motor was an earnest and
a silent man. Straker, left to himself, caught fragments
of conversation in the rear. Miss Tarrant began
it.</p>

<p>"Why did you give up your seat?"</p>

<p>"You see why," said Furnival.</p>

<p>Straker could see him saying it, flushed and fervent.
Then Furnival went one better, and overdid it.</p>

<p>"There's nothing I wouldn't give up for a chance like
this."</p>

<p>Straker heard Philippa laughing softly. He knew
she meant him to hear her, he knew she was saying
to him, "Could anything be more absurd than the
creature that I've got in here?"</p>

<p>There was a pause, and then Furnival broke out
again:</p>

<p>"I've seen Mrs. Viveash off."</p>

<p>"That," said Miss Tarrant reprovingly, "was the
least you could do."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>Furnival made that little fierce, inarticulate sound
of his before he spoke. "I hope you're satisfied. I
hope I've done enough to please you."</p>

<p>"Oh, quite enough. I shouldn't attempt to do <i>anything</i>
more if I were you."</p>

<p>After that there was silence, in which Straker felt
that Furnival was raging.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Fanny Brocklebank came to him the next morning
in the library, where he had hidden himself. She was
agitated.</p>

<p>"Put that book down," she said. "I want to talk
to you."</p>

<p>Straker obeyed.</p>

<p>"Jimmy&mdash;I'm fond of Philippa. I am, really."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;what's up?"</p>

<p>"Philippa's making a fool of herself and she doesn't
know it."</p>

<p>"Trust Philippa!"</p>

<p>"To know it?"</p>

<p>"To make a fool of anybody on earth&mdash;except herself."</p>

<p>"This is different. It's Larry Furnival."</p>

<p>"It is. And did you ever see such a spectacle of
folly?"</p>

<p>"He doesn't understand her. That's where the folly
comes in."</p>

<p>"He's not alone in it."</p>

<p>But Fanny was past the consolations of his cynicism.
Her face, not formed for gravity, was grave.</p>

<p>"He's got an idea in his head. An awful one. I'm
convinced he thinks she isn't proper."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I say!"</p>

<p>"Well, really&mdash;considering that he doesn't know her&mdash;I
can't altogether blame him. I told her so straight
out."</p>

<p>"What did she say?"</p>

<p>"She said how funny it will be when he finds out
how proper she is."</p>

<p>"So it will, won't it?"</p>

<p>Fanny considered the point.</p>

<p>"It's not half as funny as she thinks it. And, funniness
and all, she didn't like it."</p>

<p>"You can hardly expect her to," said Straker.</p>

<p>"Of course," said Fanny, musing, "there's a sort of
innocence about him, or else he couldn't think it."</p>

<p>Straker admitted that, as far as Philippa went, that
might be said of him.</p>

<p>"That's why I hate somehow to see him made a fool
of. It doesn't seem fair play, you know. It's taking
advantage of his innocence."</p>

<p>Straker <i>had</i> to laugh, for really, Furny's innocence!</p>

<p>"He always was," Fanny meditated aloud, "a fool
about women."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, then," said Straker cheerfully. "She can't
make him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She can. She does. She draws out all the folly in
him. I'm fond of Philippa&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>That meant that Fanny was blaming Philippa as
much as she could blame anybody. Immorality she
understood, and could excuse; for immorality there
was always some provocation; what she couldn't stand
was the unfairness of Philippa's proceeding, the inequality
in the game.</p>

<p>"I'm very fond of her, but&mdash;she's bad for him,
Jimmy. She's worse, far worse, than Nora, poor dear."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't worry about him if I were you."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do worry. You see, you can't help liking him.
There's something about Furny&mdash;I don't know what
it is, unless it's the turn of his nose&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you think Philippa likes him? Do you think
she's at all taken with the turn of his nose?"</p>

<p>"If she only would be! Not that he means to marry
her. That's the one point where he's firm. That's
where he's awful. Why, oh, why did I ever ask them?
I thought he was safe with Nora."</p>

<p>"Did you?"</p>

<p>"Something must be done," she cried, "to stop it."</p>

<p>"Who's to do it?"</p>

<p>"You or I. Or Will. Anybody!"</p>

<p>"Look here, Fanny, let's get it quite clear. What
are you worrying about? Are you saving Philippa
from Furnival, or Furnival from Philippa?"</p>

<p>"Philippa," Fanny moaned, "doesn't want saving.
She can take care of herself."</p>

<p>"I see. You are fond of Philippa, but your sympathies
are with Furny?"</p>

<p>"Well he can <i>feel</i>, and Philippa&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She left it there for him, as her way was.</p>

<p>"Precisely. Then why worry about Philippa?"</p>

<p>"Because it's really awful, and it's in my house that
it'll happen."</p>

<p>"How long are they staying?"</p>

<p>"Lord knows how long."</p>

<p>"Poor Fanny. You can't get them to go, can you?"</p>

<p>"I've thought of things. I've told Will he must have
an illness."</p>

<p>"And will he?"</p>

<p>"Not he. He says, as I asked them, I ought to have
the illness. But if I did she'd stay and nurse me. Besides,
if we ousted the whole lot to-morrow, <i>they'll</i>
meet again. He'll see to that; and so will Philippa."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a long pause.</p>

<p>"I want <i>you</i> to do it. I want you to tell her."</p>

<p>"Good Lord, what am I to tell her?"</p>

<p>"Tell her it isn't nice; tell her it isn't worth while;
tell her Furny isn't fair game; tell her anything you
can think of that'll stop her."</p>

<p>"I don't see myself&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I do. She won't listen to anybody but you."</p>

<p>"Why me?"</p>

<p>"She respects you."</p>

<p>"I doubt it. Why should she?"</p>

<p>"Because you've never made yourself a spectacle of
folly. You've never told her you're in love with her."</p>

<p>"But I'm not," said poor Straker.</p>

<p>"She doesn't know that. And if she did she'd respect
you all the more."</p>

<p>"Dear Fanny, I'd do a great deal for you, but I can't
do that. I can't, really. It wouldn't be a bit of good."</p>

<p>"You could speak," Fanny said, "to Furny."</p>

<p>"I couldn't."</p>

<p>"Why <i>not</i>?" she cried, in desperation.</p>

<p>"Because, if I did, I should have to assume things&mdash;things
that you cannot decently assume. I can't speak
to him. Not, that is, unless he speaks to me."</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>He did speak to him that very night.</p>

<p>It was after ten o'clock, and Straker, who ought to
have been in the drawing-room playing bridge, or in
the billiard-room playing billiards, or in the smoking-room
talking to Brocklebank&mdash;Straker, who ought to
have known better, had sneaked into the library to
have a look at a brief he'd just got. He ought to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
known better, for he knew, everybody knew, that after
ten o'clock the library at Amberley was set apart as a
refuge for any two persons who desired uninterrupted
communion with each other. He himself, in the library
at Amberley&mdash;but that was more than two years ago,
so far before Philippa's time that he did not associate
her with the library at Amberley. He only knew that
Furnival had spent a good deal of time in it with Nora
Viveash, and poor Nora was gone. It was poor Nora's
departure, in fact, that made him feel that the library
was now open to him.</p>

<p>Now the library at Amberley was fitted, as a library
should be, with a silent door, a door with an inaudible
latch and pneumatic hinges. It shut itself behind
Straker with a soft sigh.</p>

<p>The long room was dim and apparently deserted.
Drawn blinds obscured the lucid summer night behind
the three windows opposite the door. One small electric
globe hung lit under its opaline veil in the corner
by the end window on the right.</p>

<p>Straker at the doorway turned on the full blaze of
the great ring that hung above the central table where
he meant to work. It revealed, seated on the lounge
in the inner, the unilluminated corner on the right,
Miss Tarrant and Laurence Furnival.</p>

<p>To his intense relief, Straker perceived that the
whole length of the lounge was between the two. Miss
Tarrant at her end was sitting bolt upright with her
scarf gathered close about her; she was looking under
her eyelids and down her beautiful nose at Furnival,
who at his end was all huddled among the cushions
as if she had flung him there. Their attitudes suggested
that their interview had ended in distance and
disaster. The effect was so marked that Straker seized
it in an instant.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>He was about to withdraw as noiselessly as he had
entered, but Miss Tarrant (not Furnival; Furnival had
not so much as raised his head)&mdash;Miss Tarrant had
seen him and signed to him to stay.</p>

<p>"You needn't go," she said. "<i>I'm</i> going."</p>

<p>She rose and passed her companion without looking
at him, in a sort of averted and offended majesty, and
came slowly down the room. Straker waited by the
door to open it for her.</p>

<p>On the threshold she turned to him and murmured:
"Don't go away. Go in and talk to him&mdash;about&mdash;about
anything."</p>

<p>It struck him as extraordinary that she should say
this to him, that she should ask him to go in and see
what she had done to the man.</p>

<p>The door swung on her with its soft sigh, shutting
him in with Furnival. He hesitated a moment by the
door.</p>

<p>"Come in if you want to," said Furnival. "I'm
going, too."</p>

<p>He had risen, a little unsteadily. As he advanced,
Straker saw that his face bore traces of violent emotion.
His tie was a little crooked and his hair pushed from
the forehead that had been hidden by his hands. His
moustache no longer curled crisply upward; it hung
limp over his troubled mouth. Furnival looked as if
he had been drinking. But Furnival did not drink.
Straker saw that he meant in his madness to follow
Philippa.</p>

<p>He turned down the lights that beat on him.</p>

<p>"Don't," said Furnival. "I'm going all right."</p>

<p>Straker held the door to. "I wouldn't," he said, "if
I were you. Not yet."</p>

<p>Furnival made the queer throat sound that came
from him when words failed him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>Straker put his hand on the young man's shoulder.
He remembered how Mrs. Viveash had asked him to
look after Furny, to stand by him if he had a bad time.
She had foreseen, in the fierce clairvoyance of her passion,
that he was going to have one. And, by Heaven!
it had come.</p>

<p>Furnival struggled for utterance. "All right," he
said thickly.</p>

<p>He wasn't going after her. He had been trying to
get away from Straker; but Straker had been too much
for him. Besides, he had understood Straker's delicacy
in turning down the lights, and he didn't want to show
himself just yet to the others.</p>

<p>They strolled together amicably toward the lounge
and sat there.</p>

<p>Straker had intended to say, "What's up?" but other
words were given him.</p>

<p>"What's Philippa been up to?"</p>

<p>Furnival pulled himself together. "Nothing," he
replied. "It was me."</p>

<p>"What did you do?"</p>

<p>Furnival was silent.</p>

<p>"Did you propose to her, or what?"</p>

<p>"I made," said Furnival, "a sort of p-proposal."</p>

<p>"That she should count the world well lost&mdash;was
that it?"</p>

<p>"Well, she knew I wasn't going to marry anybody,
and I knew she wasn't going to marry me. Now was
she?"</p>

<p>"No. She most distinctly wasn't."</p>

<p>"Very well, then&mdash;how was I to know? I could have
sworn&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He hid his face in his hands again.</p>

<p>"The fact is, I made the devil of a mistake."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Straker. "I saw you making it."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>Furnival's face emerged angry.</p>

<p>"Then why on earth didn't you <i>tell</i> me? I asked
you. Why couldn't you tell me what she was like?"</p>

<p>"You don't tell," said Straker.</p>

<p>Furnival groaned. "I can't make it out <i>now</i>. It's
not as if she hadn't got a t-t-temperament."</p>

<p>"But she hasn't. <i>That</i> was the mistake you made."</p>

<p>"You'd have made it yourself," said Furnival.</p>

<p>"I have. She's taken me in. She <i>looks</i> as if she had
temperament&mdash;she behaves as if she had&mdash;oceans. And
she hasn't, not a scrap."</p>

<p>"Then what does she do it for? What does she do
it for, Straker?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what she does it for. She doesn't
know herself. There's a sort of innocence about her."</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Furnival pensively, "it's innocence."</p>

<p>"Whatever it is, it's the quality of her defect. She
can't let us alone. It amuses her to see us squirm.
But she doesn't know, my dear fellow, what it feels
like; because, you see, she doesn't feel. She couldn't
tell, of course, the lengths <i>you'd</i> go to."</p>

<p>Straker was thinking how horrible it must have been
for Philippa. Then he reflected that it must have been
pretty horrible for Furny, too&mdash;so unexpected. At
that point he remembered that for Philippa it had not
been altogether unexpected; Fanny had warned her of
this very thing.</p>

<p>"How&mdash;did she&mdash;take it?" he inquired tentatively.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, she sat there&mdash;where you are now&mdash;and
lammed into me. She made me feel as if I were
a 	cad and a beast and a ruffian&mdash;as if I wanted k-kick-kicking.
She said she wouldn't have seen that I existed
if it hadn't been for Fanny Brocklebank&mdash;I was
her friend's guest&mdash;and when I tried to defend myself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
she turned and talked to me about things, Straker, till
I blushed. I'm b-blushing now."</p>

<p>He was.</p>

<p>"And, of course, after that, I've got to go."</p>

<p>"Was that all?" said Straker.</p>

<p>"No, it wasn't. I can't tell you the <i>other</i> things she
said."</p>

<p>For a moment Furny's eyes took on a marvelous
solemnity, as if they were holding for a moment some
sort of holy, supersensuous vision.</p>

<p>Then suddenly they grew reminiscent.</p>

<p>"How could I tell, Straker, how could I possibly
tell?"</p>

<p>And Straker, remembering the dance that Philippa
had led him, and her appearance, and the things, the
uncommonly queer things she had done to him with
her eyes, wondered how Furny <i>could</i> have told, how
he could have avoided drawing the inferences, the uncommonly
queer inferences, he drew. He'd have drawn
them himself if he had not known Philippa so well.</p>

<p>"What I want to know," said Furnival, "is what she
did it for?"</p>

<p>He rose, straightening himself.</p>

<p>"Anyhow, I've got to go."</p>

<p>"Did she say so?"</p>

<p>"No, she didn't. She said it wasn't necessary. <i>That</i>
was innocent, Straker, if you like."</p>

<p>"Oh, jolly innocent," said Straker.</p>

<p>"But I'm going all the same. I'm going before breakfast,
by the seven-fifty train."</p>

<p>And he went. Straker saw him off.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>


<h3>IX</h3>

<p>That was far and away the most disconcerting thing
that had happened at Amberley within Straker's recollection.</p>

<p>It must have been very disagreeable for Philippa.</p>

<p>When, five days ago, he had wondered if he would
ever live to see Philippa disconcerted, he had not contemplated
anything like this. Neither, he was inclined
to think, had Philippa in the beginning. She could
have had no idea what she was letting herself in for.
That she had let herself in was, to Straker's mind, the
awful part of it.</p>

<p>As he walked home from the station he called up all
his cleverness, all his tact and delicacy, to hide his
knowledge of it from Philippa. He tried to make himself
forget it, lest by a word or a look she should gather
that he knew. He did not want to see her disconcerted.</p>

<p>The short cut to Amberley from the station leads
through a side gate into the turning at the bottom of
the east walk. Straker, as he rounded the turning, saw
Miss Tarrant not five yards off, coming down the walk.</p>

<p>He was not ready for her, and his first instinct, if he
could have yielded to it, would have been to fly. That
was his delicacy.</p>

<p>He met her with a remark on the beauty of the
morning. That was his tact.</p>

<p>He tried to look as if he hadn't been to see Furnival
off at the station, as if the beauty of the morning sufficiently
accounted for his appearance at that early hour.
The hour, indeed, was so disgustingly early that he
would have half an hour to put through with Philippa
before breakfast.</p>

<p>But Miss Tarrant ignored the beauty of the morning.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>"What have you done," she said, "with Mr. Furnival?"</p>

<p>It was Straker who was disconcerted now.</p>

<p>"What have I done with him?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Where is he?"</p>

<p>Straker's tact was at a disadvantage, but his delicacy
instantly suggested that if Miss Tarrant was not disconcerted
it was because she didn't know he knew.
That made it all right.</p>

<p>"He's in the seven-fifty train."</p>

<p>A light leaped in her eyes; the light of defiance and
pursuit, the light of the hunter's lust frustrated and
of the hunter's ire.</p>

<p>"You must get him back again," she said.</p>

<p>"I can't," said Straker. "He's gone on business."
(He still used tact with her.) "He had to go."</p>

<p>"He hadn't," said she. "That's all rubbish."</p>

<p>Her tone trod his scruples down and trampled on
them, and Straker felt that tact and delicacy required
of him no more. She had given herself away at last;
she had let herself in for the whole calamity of his
knowledge, and he didn't know how she proposed to
get out of it this time. And he wasn't going to help
her. Not he!</p>

<p>They faced each other as they stood there in the
narrow walk, and his knowledge challenged her
dumbly for a moment. Then he spoke.</p>

<p>"Look here, what do you want him for? Why can't
you let the poor chap alone?"</p>

<p>"What do you suppose I want him for?"</p>

<p>"I've no business to suppose anything. I don't
know. But I'm not going to get him back for you."</p>

<p>Something flitted across her face and shifted the
wide gaze of her eyes. Straker went on without remorse.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>"You know perfectly well the state he's in, and you
know how he got into it."</p>

<p>"Yes. And I know," she said, "what you think of
me."</p>

<p>"It's more than I do," said Straker.</p>

<p>She smiled subtly, mysteriously, tolerantly, as it
were.</p>

<p>"What did you do it for, Philippa?"</p>

<p>Her smile grew more subtle, more tolerant, more
mysterious; it measured him and found him wanting.</p>

<p>"If I told you," she said, "I don't think you'd understand.
But I'll try and make you."</p>

<p>She turned with him and they walked slowly toward
the house.</p>

<p>"You saw," she said, "where he was going before I
came? I got him out of that, didn't I?"</p>

<p>He was silent, absorbed in contemplating the amazing
fabric of her thought.</p>

<p>"Does it very much matter how I did it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Straker, "if you ask me, I should say it
did. The last state of him, to my mind, was decidedly
worse than the first."</p>

<p>"What do you suppose I did to him?"</p>

<p>"If you want the frankness of a brother, there's no
doubt you&mdash;led him on."</p>

<p>"I led him on&mdash;to heights he'd never have contemplated
without me."</p>

<p>Straker tried to eliminate all expression from his face.</p>

<p>"What do you suppose I did to him last night?"</p>

<p>"I can only suppose you led him further, since he
went further."</p>

<p>By this time Straker's tact and delicacy were all
gone.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Miss Tarrant, "he went pretty far. But,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
on the whole, it's just as well he did, seeing what's
come of it."</p>

<p>"What <i>has</i> come of it?"</p>

<p>"Well, I think he realizes that he has a soul. That's
something."</p>

<p>"I didn't know it was his soul you were concerned
with."</p>

<p>"He didn't, either. Did he tell you what I said to
him?"</p>

<p>"He told me you gave him a dressing down. But
there was something that he wouldn't tell. What <i>did</i>
you say to him?"</p>

<p>"I said I supposed, after all, he had a soul, and I
asked him what he meant to do about it."</p>

<p>"What does he?"</p>

<p>"That's what I want him back for," she said, "to see.
Whatever he does with it, practically I've saved it."</p>

<p>She turned to him, lucid and triumphant.</p>

<p>"Could any other woman have done it? Do you see
Mary Probyn doing it?"</p>

<p>"Not that way."</p>

<p>"It was the only way. You must," she said, "have
temperament."</p>

<p>The word took Straker's breath away.</p>

<p>"You didn't like the way I did it. I can't help that.
I had to use the means at my disposal. If I hadn't led
him on how could I have got hold of him? If I hadn't
led him further how could I have got him on an inch?"</p>

<p>"So that," said Straker quietly, "is what you did it
for?"</p>

<p>"You've seen him," she answered. "You don't seriously
suppose I could have done it for anything else!
What possible use had I for that young man?"</p>

<p>He remembered that that was what she had said
about Mr. Higginson. But he confessed that, for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
lady in a disconcerting situation, she had shown genius
in extricating herself.</p>

<p>Fanny's house party broke up and scattered the next
day. A week later Straker and Will Brocklebank saw
Furnival in the Park. He was driving a motor beyond
his means in the society of a lady whom he certainly
could not afford.</p>

<p>"Good God!" said Brocklebank. "That's Philippa."</p>

<p>By which he meant, not that Furnival's lady in the
least resembled Philippa, but that she showed the
heights to which Philippa had led him on.</p>


<h3>X</h3>

<p>Brocklebank agreed with Straker that they had got
to get him out of that.</p>

<p>It was difficult, because the thing had come upon
Furnival like a madness. He would have had more
chance if he had been a man with a talent or an absorbing
occupation, a politician, an editor, a journalist;
if he had even been, Brocklebank lamented, on the
London Borough Council it might have made him less
dependent on the sympathy of ruinous ladies. But
the Home Office provided no competitive distraction.</p>

<p>What was worse, it kept him on the scene of his
temptation.</p>

<p>If it hadn't been for the Home Office he might have
gone abroad with the Brocklebanks; they had wanted
him to go. Straker did what he could for him. He
gave him five days' yachting in August, and he tried
to get him away for week-ends in September; but
Furnival wouldn't go. Then Straker went away for
his own holiday, and when he came back he had lost
sight of Furnival. So had the Home Office.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>For three months Furnival went under. Then one
day he emerged. The Higginsons (Mary Probyn and
her husband) ran up against him in Piccadilly, or
rather, he ran up against them, and their forms interposed
an effective barrier to flight. He was looking
so wretchedly ill that their hearts warmed to him, and
they asked him to dine with them that evening, or the
next, or&mdash;well, the next after that. He refused steadily,
but Mary managed to worm his address out of him
and sent it on to Fanny Brocklebank that night.</p>

<p>Then the Brocklebanks, with prodigious forbearance
and persistence, went to work on him. Once they succeeded
in getting well hold of him they wouldn't let
him go, and between them, very gradually, they got
him straight. He hadn't, Fanny discovered, been so
very awful; he had flung away all that he had on one
expensive woman and he had lost his job. Brocklebank
found him another in an insurance office where
Fanny's brother was a director. Then Fanny settled
down to the really serious business of settling Furnival.
She was always asking him down to Amberley when
the place was quiet, by which she meant when Philippa
Tarrant wasn't there. She was always asking nice girls
down to meet him. She worked at it hard for a whole
year, and then she said that if it didn't come off that
summer she would have to give it up.</p>

<p>The obstacle to her scheme for Furny's settlement
was his imperishable repugnance to the legal tie. It
had become, Fanny declared, a regular obsession. All
this she confided to Straker as she lunched with him
one day in his perfectly appointed club in Dover Street.
Furny was coming down to Amberley, she said, in July;
and she added, "It would do you good, Jimmy, to come,
too."</p>

<p>She was gazing at him with a look that he had come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
to know, having known Fanny for fifteen years. A
tender, rather dreamy look it was, but distinctly speculative.
It was directed to the silver streaks in Straker's
hair on a line with his eyeglasses, and he knew that
Fanny was making a calculation and saying to herself
that it must be quite fifteen years or more.</p>

<p>Straker was getting on.</p>

<p>A week at Amberley would do him all the good in
the world. She rather hoped&mdash;though she couldn't altogether
promise him&mdash;that a certain lady in whom he
was interested (he needn't try to look as if he wasn't)
would be there.</p>

<p>"<i>Not</i> Philippa?" he asked wearily.</p>

<p>"No, Jimmy, not Philippa. You know whom I
mean."</p>

<p>He did. He went down to Amberley in July, arriving
early in a golden and benignant afternoon. It was
precisely two years since he had been there with
Philippa. It was very quiet this year, so quiet that
he had an hour alone with Fanny on the terrace before
tea. Brocklebank had taken the others off somewhere
in his motor.</p>

<p>She broke it to him that the lady in whom he was
interested wasn't there. Straker smiled. He knew
she wouldn't be. The others, Fanny explained, were
Laurence Furnival and his Idea.</p>

<p>"His Idea?"</p>

<p>"His Idea, Jimmy, of everything that's lovable."</p>

<p>There was a luminous pause in which Fanny let it
sink into him.</p>

<p>"Then it's come off, has it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, but I think it's coming."</p>

<p>"Dear Mrs. Brockles, how did you manage it?"</p>

<p>"I didn't. That's the beauty of it. He managed it
himself. He asked me to have her down."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>She let him take that in, too, in all its immense significance.</p>

<p>"Who is she?"</p>

<p>"Little Molly Milner&mdash;a niece of Nora Viveash's.
He met her there last winter."</p>

<p>Their eyes met, full of remembrance.</p>

<p>"If anybody managed it, it was Nora. Jimmy, do
you know, that woman's a perfect dear."</p>

<p>"I know you always said so."</p>

<p>"<i>He</i> says so. He says she behaved like an angel,
like a saint, about it. When you think how she cared!
I suppose she saw it was the way to save him."</p>

<p>Straker was silent. He saw Nora Viveash as he had
seen her on the terrace two years ago, on the day of
Philippa's arrival; and as she had come to him afterward
and asked him to stand by Furnival in his bad
hour.</p>

<p>"What is it like, Furny's Idea?" he asked presently.</p>

<p>"It's rather like Nora, only different. It's her niece,
you know."</p>

<p>"If it's Nora's niece, it must be very young."</p>

<p>"It is. It's absurdly young. But, oh, so determined!"</p>

<p>"Has she by any chance got Nora's temperament?"</p>

<p>"She's got her own temperament," said Fanny.</p>

<p>Straker meditated on that.</p>

<p>"How does it take him?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"It takes him beautifully. It makes him very quiet,
and a little sad. That's why I think it's coming."</p>

<p>Fanny also meditated.</p>

<p>"Yes. It's coming. There's only one thing, Jimmy.
Philippa's coming, too. She's coming to-day, by that
four-something train."</p>

<p>"My dear Fanny, how you <i>do</i> mix 'em!"</p>

<p>It was his tribute to her enduring quality.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>"I asked her before I knew Laurence Furnival was
coming."</p>

<p>"<i>She</i> knew?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I think so."</p>

<p>They looked at each other. Then Fanny spoke.</p>

<p>"Jimmy," she said, "do you think you could make
love to Philippa? Just, <i>just</i>," she entreated (when,
indeed, had she not appealed to him to save her from
the consequences of her indiscretions?), "until Furny
goes?"</p>

<p>Straker's diplomatic reply was cut short by the appearance
of Laurence Furnival and Molly Milner,
Nora's niece. They came down the long terrace with
the sun upon them. She was all in white, with here
and there a touch of delicate green. She was very
young; and, yes, she was very like Mrs. Viveash, with
all the difference of her youth and of her soul.</p>

<p>Furnival was almost pathetically pleased to see
Straker there; and Miss Milner, flushed but serene in
the moment of introduction, said that she had heard of
Mr. Straker very often from&mdash;she hesitated, and
Straker saw what Fanny had meant when she said that
the young girl had a temperament of her own&mdash;from
Mr. Furnival. Her charming smile implied that she
was aware that Straker counted, and aware of all that
he had done for Furnival.</p>

<p>As he watched her he began to see how different she
was from Nora Viveash. She was grave and extraordinarily
quiet, Furnival's young girl. He measured the
difference by the power she had of making Furnival&mdash;as
Straker put it&mdash;different from himself. She had
made him grave and quiet, too. Not that he had by
any means lost his engaging spontaneity; only the
spontaneous, the ungovernable thing about him was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
the divine shyness and the wonder which he was utterly
unable to conceal.</p>

<p>It was at its height, it had spread its own silence all
around it, when, in that stillness which was her hour,
her moment, Philippa appeared.</p>

<p>She came down the terrace, golden for her as it had
been two years ago; she came slowly, more slowly than
ever, with a touch of exaggeration in her rhythm, in
her delay, in the poise of her head, and in all her gestures;
the shade too much that Straker had malignly
prophesied for her. But with it all she was more beautiful,
and, he could see, more dangerous, than ever.</p>

<p>She had greeted the three of them, Fanny, Brocklebank,
and Straker, with that increase, that excess of
manner; and then she saw Furnival standing very
straight in front of her, holding out his hand.</p>

<p>"Mr. Furnival&mdash;but&mdash;how <i>nice</i>!"</p>

<p>Furnival had sat down again, rather abruptly, beside
Molly Milner, and Fanny, visibly perturbed, was
murmuring the young girl's name.</p>

<p>Something passed over Miss Tarrant's face like the
withdrawing of a veil. She was not prepared for Molly
Milner. She had not expected to find anything like
that at Amberley. It was not what she supposed that
Furnival had come for. But, whatever he had come
for, that, the unexpected, was what Furnival was there
for now. It was disconcerting.</p>

<p>Philippa, in fact, was disconcerted.</p>

<p>All this Straker took in; he took in also, in a flash,
the look that passed between Miss Tarrant and Miss
Milner. Philippa's look was wonderful, a smile flung
down from her heights into the old dusty lists of sex
to challenge that young Innocence. Miss Milner's
look was even more wonderful than Philippa's; grave
and abstracted, it left Philippa's smile lying where she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
had flung it; she wasn't going, it said, to take <i>that</i> up.</p>

<p>And yet a duel went on between them, a duel conducted
with proper propriety on either side. It lasted
about half an hour. Philippa's manner said plainly to
Miss Milner: "My child, you have got hold of something
that isn't good for you, something that doesn't
belong to you, something that you are not old enough
or clever enough to keep, something that you will not
be permitted to keep. You had better drop it." Miss
Milner's manner said still more plainly to Philippa:
"I don't know what you're driving at, but you don't
suppose I take you seriously, do you?" It said nothing
at all about Laurence Furnival. That was where Miss
Milner's manner scored.</p>

<p>In short, it was a very pretty duel, and it ended in
Miss Milner's refusing to accompany Furnival to the
Amberley woods and in Philippa's carrying him off
bodily (Straker noted that she scored a point there, or
seemed to score). As they went Miss Milner was seen
to smile, subtly, for all her innocence. She lent herself
with great sweetness to Brocklebank's desire to show
her his prize roses.</p>

<p>Straker was left alone with Fanny.</p>

<p>Fanny was extremely agitated by the sight of Furnival's
capture. "Jimmy," she said, "haven't I been
good to you? Haven't I been an angel? Haven't I
done every mortal thing I could for you?"</p>

<p>He admitted that she had.</p>

<p>"Well, then, now you've got to do something for me.
You've got to look after Philippa. Don't let her get
at him."</p>

<p>"No fear."</p>

<p>But Fanny insisted that he had seen Philippa carrying
Furnival off under Molly Milner's innocent nose,
and that her manner of appropriating him, too, vividly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
recalled the evening of her arrival two years ago, when
he would remember what had happened to poor Nora's
nose.</p>

<p>"She took him from Nora."</p>

<p>"My dear Fanny, that was an act of the highest
moral&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't talk to me about your highest moral anything.
<i>I</i> know what it was."</p>

<p>"Besides, she didn't take him from Nora," she went
on, ignoring her previous line of argument. "He took
himself. He was getting tired of her."</p>

<p>"Well," said Straker, "he isn't tired of Miss Milner."</p>

<p>"She's taken him off <i>there</i>," said Fanny. She nodded
gloomily toward the Amberley woods.</p>

<p>Straker smiled. He was looking westward over the
shining fields where he had once walked with Philippa.
Already they were returning. Furnival had not allowed
himself to be taken very far. As they approached
Straker saw that Philippa was pouring herself out at
Furnival and that Furnival was not absorbing any of
it; he was absorbed in his Idea. His Idea had made
him absolutely impervious to Philippa. All this Straker
saw.</p>

<p>He made himself very attentive to Miss Tarrant that
evening, and after dinner, at her request, he walked
with her on the terrace. Over the low wall they could
see Furnival in the rose garden with Miss Milner.
They saw him give her a rose, which the young girl
pinned in the bosom of her gown.</p>

<p>"Aren't they wonderful?" said Philippa. "Did you
ever see anything under heaven so young?"</p>

<p>"She is older than he is," said Straker.</p>

<p>"Do you remember when he wanted to give <i>me</i> one
and I wouldn't take it?"</p>

<p>"I have not forgotten."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>The lovers wandered on down the rose garden and
Philippa looked after them. Then she turned to
Straker.</p>

<p>"I've had a long talk with him. I've told him that
he must settle down and that he couldn't do a better
thing for himself than&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paused.</p>

<p>"Well," said Straker, "it <i>looks</i> like it, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Philippa. "It looks like it."</p>

<p>They talked of other things.</p>

<p>"I am going," she said presently, "to ask Miss Milner
to stay with me."</p>

<p>Straker didn't respond. He was thinking deeply.
Her face was so mysterious, so ominous, that yet again
he wondered what she might be up to. He confessed
to himself that this time he didn't know. But he made
her promise to go on the river with him the next day.
They were to start at eleven-thirty.</p>

<p>At eleven Fanny came to him in the library.</p>

<p>"She's gone," said Fanny. "She's left a little note
for you. She said you'd forgive her, you'd understand."</p>

<p>"Do <i>you</i>?" said Straker.</p>

<p>"She said she was going to be straight and see this
thing through."</p>

<p>"What thing?"</p>

<p>"Furny's thing. What else do you suppose she's
thinking of? She said she'd only got to lift her little
finger and he'd come back to her; she said there ought
to be fair play. Do you see? She's gone away&mdash;to
save him."</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" said Straker.</p>

<p>But he saw.

<h3>XI</h3>

<p>It was nearly twelve months before he heard again
from Miss Tarrant. Then one day she wrote and
asked him to come and have tea with her at her flat
in Lexham Gardens.</p>

<p>He went. His entrance coincided with the departure
of Laurence Furnival and a lady whom Philippa introduced
to him as Mrs. Laurence, whom, she said, he
would remember under another name.</p>

<p>Furnival's wife was younger than ever and more like
Nora Viveash and more different. When the door
closed on them Philippa turned to him with her radiance
(the least bit overdone).</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> made that marriage," she said, and staggered him.</p>

<p>"Surely," he said, "it was made in heaven."</p>

<p>"If this room is heaven. It was made here, six
months ago."</p>

<p>She faced him with all his memories. With all his
memories and her own she faced him radiantly.</p>

<p>"You know now," she said, "<i>why I did it</i>. It was
worth while, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>His voice struggled with his memories and stuck. It
stuck in his throat.</p>

<p>Before he left he begged her congratulations on a
little affair of his own; a rather unhappy affair which
had ended happily the week before last. He did not
tell her that, if it hadn't been for the things dear Fanny
Brocklebank had done for him, the way she had mixed
herself up with his unhappy little affair, it might have
ended happily a year ago.</p>

<p>"But," said Philippa, "how beautiful!"</p>

<p>He never saw Miss Tarrant again. Their correspondence
ceased after his marriage, and he gathered
that she had no longer any use for him.

<h3>I</h3>

<p>All afternoon since three o'clock he had sat cooling
his heels in a corner of the hotel veranda. And all
afternoon he had been a spectacle of interest to the
beautiful cosmopolitan creature who watched him from
her seat under the palm tree in the corresponding
corner.</p>

<p>She had two men with her, and when she was not
occupied with one or both of them she turned her
splendid eyes, gaily or solemnly, on Oscar Thesiger.
And every time she turned them Thesiger in his corner
darkened and flushed and bit his moustache and
twirled it, while his eyes answered hers as he believed
they meant him to answer. Oscar Thesiger was not a
cosmopolitan himself for nothing.</p>

<p>And all the time while he looked at her he was
thinking, thinking very miserably, of little Vera
Walters.</p>

<p>She had refused him yesterday evening without giving
any reason.</p>

<p>Her cruelty (if it wasn't cruelty he'd like to know
what it was) remained unexplained, incomprehensible
to Oscar Thesiger.</p>

<p>For, if she didn't mean to marry him, why on earth
had they asked him to go abroad with them? Why had
they dragged him about with them for five weeks, up
and down the Riviera? Why was he there now, cooling
his heels in the veranda of the H&ocirc;tel M&eacute;diterran&eacute;e,
Cannes? That was where the cruelty, the infernal
cruelty came in.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>And her reasons&mdash;if she had only given him her
reasons. It was all he asked for. But of course she
hadn't any.</p>

<p>What possible reason could she have? It wasn't
as if he'd been a bad lot like her French brother-in-law,
Paul de Vignolles (good Lord, the things he knew about
de Vignolles!). He was, as men go, a decent sort. He
had always known where to draw the line (de Vignolles
didn't). And he wasn't ugly, like de Vignolles. On
the contrary, he was, as men go, distinctly good looking;
he knew he was; the glances of the beautiful and
hypothetical stranger assured him of it, and he had
looked in the glass not half an hour ago to reassure
himself. Solid he was, and well built, and he had decorative
points that pleased: a fresh color, eyes that
flashed blue round a throbbing black, a crisp tawny
curl in his short moustache and shorter hair. He was
well off; there wasn't a thing she wanted that he
couldn't give her. And he was the admired and appreciated
friend of her admired and appreciated sister,
Agatha de Vignolles.</p>

<p>And for poor little Vera, as far as he could see, the
alternatives to marrying him were dismal. It was
either marrying a Frenchman, since Agatha had married
one, or living forever with that admired and appreciated
woman, looking after the little girls, Ninon
and Odette. She had been looking after them ever
since he had first met her and fallen, with some violence,
in love with her.</p>

<p>It was a bit late now to go back on all that. It had
been an understood thing. Vera herself had understood
it, and she&mdash;well, she had lent herself to it very
sweetly, shyly, and beautifully, as Vera would. If she
hadn't he wouldn't have had a word to say against her
decision.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>It wasn't as if she had been a cold and selfish woman
like her sister. She wasn't cold; and, as for selfish, he
had seen her with Agatha and the little girls. It was
through the little girls that he had made love to her,
that being the surest and shortest way. He had
worked it through Ninon and Odette; he had carried
them on his back by turns that very afternoon, in the
heat of the sun, all the way, that terrible winding way,
up the Californie Hill to the Observatory at the top,
where they had sat drinking coffee and eating brioches,
he and Vera and Ninon and Odette. What on earth
did she suppose he did it for?</p>

<p>But she hadn't supposed anything; she had simply
understood, and had been adorable to him all afternoon.
Not that she had said much (Vera didn't say
things); but her eyes, her eyes had given her away;
they had been as soft for him as they had been for
Ninon and Odette.</p>

<p>Why, oh why, hadn't he done it, then?</p>

<p>He couldn't, because of those two infernal, bilingual
little monkeys. They were clinging to her skirts all
the way down the hill.</p>

<p>They were all going to Nice the next day; and that
evening the de Vignolles had gone down to the Casino
and Vera hadn't gone. It would have been all right if
the children had not been allowed to sit up to see the
conjuror conjuring in the lounge. But they had sat
up; and that had brought it to ten o'clock before he
had Vera for a minute to himself.</p>

<p>He may have chosen his moment badly (it wasn't
easy to choose it well, living, as the de Vignolles did, in
public), and perhaps, if they hadn't had that little difference
of opinion, he and she&mdash;&mdash; It was in the
evening that they had had it, between the conjuring
tricks and the children's chatter, in the public, the intolerably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
public lounge, and it was only a difference
of opinion, opinion concerning the beauty of the beautiful
and hypothetical lady who was looking at him
then, who had never ceased to look at him and Vera
and the children when any of them were about.</p>

<p>Thesiger couldn't get Vera to say that the lady was
beautiful, and the little that she did say implied that
you couldn't be beautiful if you looked like that. She
was not beautiful (Thesiger had admitted it) in Vera's
way, and on the whole he was glad to think that Vera
didn't look like that; but there was, he had contended,
a beauty absolute and above opinion, and the lady had
it. That was all. Perhaps, now he came to think of it,
he ought not to have drawn Vera's attention to her;
for he knew what Vera had thought of her by the
things she hadn't said, and, what was worse, he knew
what Paul de Vignolles thought by the things he <i>had</i>
said, things implying that, if the lady were honest, appearances
were against her. Of her and of her honesty
Thesiger didn't feel very sure himself. He found himself
continually looking at her to make sure. He had
been looking at her then, across the little table in the
lounge where she and her two men sat drinking coffee
and liqueurs. She kept thrusting her face between the
two as she talked; she had a rose in her bronze hair,
which made him dubious; and when their eyes met, as
they were always meeting (how could he help it?), his
doubt leaped in him and fastened on her face. Her
face had held him for a moment so with all his doubt,
and he had stared at her and flamed in a curious excitement
born of Vera's presence and of hers, while
he smiled to himself furtively under the moustache
he bit.</p>

<p>And then he had seen Vera looking at him.</p>

<p>For a moment she had looked at him, with wide,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
grave eyes that stayed wide until she turned her head
away suddenly.</p>

<p>And the lady, who was the cause of it all, had got
up and removed herself, softly and, for her, inconspicuously,
taking her two men with her out into the
garden and the night.</p>

<p>Of course he had understood Vera. He had seen that
it was jealousy, feminine jealousy. And that was why,
in the drawing-room afterward, he had hurried up with
his proposal, to make it all straight.</p>

<p>And she had refused him without giving any reasons.
She had gone off to Nice by the one-forty-four train
with the de Vignolles, Paul and Agatha and Ninon and
Odette; she had left him in the great, gay, exotic hotel
above the palm trees, above the rose and ivory town,
above the sea; left him alone with the loveliness that
made him mad and miserable; left him cooling his
heels on the veranda, under the gaze, the distinctly
interested gaze, of the beautiful and hypothetical
stranger.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>How beautiful she was he realized after a dinner
which figured in his memory as one of those dinners
which he had not enjoyed, though as a matter of fact
he <i>had</i> enjoyed it or the mere distraction of it. By
way of distraction he had taken the table next to hers,
facing her where she sat between her two men.</p>

<p>She was an American; that fact had at first made
his doubt itself a little dubious. And she was probably
from the South (they were different there). Hence
her softness, her full tone, her richness and her glow.
Hence her exotic strain that went so well with the false
tropics of the scene. But whether she were a provincial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
or an urban, or, as she seemed, a cosmopolitan
splendor, Thesiger was not cosmopolitan enough to
tell. She might have been the supreme flower of her
astounding country. She might have been, for all he
knew, unique.</p>

<p>She was tall, and her body, large and massive,
achieved the grace of slenderness from the sheer perfection
of its lines. Her attire, within the bounds of
its subservience to Paris, was certainly unique. It was
wonderful the amount of decoration she could carry
without being the worse for it. Her head alone, over
and above its bronze hair, coil on coil and curl on curl,
sustained several large tortoise-shell pins, a gold lace
fillet, and a rose over each ear. It was no more to her
than a bit of black ribbon to a young girl. Old rose
and young rose mingled delicately in the silks and
gauzes of her gown; here and there a topaz flashed
rose from her bodice and from the dusk of her bared
neck. There was a fine dusk in her whiteness and in
the rose of her face, and in the purplish streaks under
her eyes, and deeper dusks about the roots of her hair.
And gold sprang out of her darkness there; gold and
bronze and copper gleamed and glowed and flamed on
every coil and curl. Her eyes held the light gloriously;
they were of a luminous, tawny brown, wide apart, and
slightly round, with a sudden fineness at the corners.
The lids had thick black lashes, so short that when
they drooped they had the effect of narrowing her eyes
without darkening them. Her nose, small and straight,
was a shade too broadly rounded at the tip, but that
defect gave a sort of softness to her splendor. Of her
mouth Thesiger could not judge; he hadn't seen it at
rest; and when she talked her white teeth flashed at
him and disturbed him.</p>

<p>As he looked at her, disturbed, and he hoped, disturbing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
he thought of little Vera Walters, of her slender
virginal body, of her small virginal face, smooth,
firm, and slightly pointed like a bud, of her gray eyes,
clear as water, and of the pale gold and fawn of her
hair. He thought of her tenderness and of her cruelty.
He caught himself frowning at it over the <i>mousse de
volaille</i> he was eating; and just then he thought that
the other woman who was looking at him smiled. Most
certainly she gazed.</p>

<p>The gaze was condoned and allowed by the two men
who followed it.</p>

<p>She was superb; but the men, the men were awful.
To begin with, they were American, altogether too
American for Thesiger. One, whom the lady addressed
with some ceremony as Mr. Tarbuck, was the big, full
type, florid, rough-hewn, civilized by the cut of his
clothes and the excessive cleanness of his shaving.
From the first he had oppressed and offended Thesiger
by his large and intolerably genial presence. The
other, whom she familiarly and caressingly called
Binky, was small and lean and yellow; he had a young
face with old, nervous lines in it, the twitching, tortured
lines of the victim of premature high pressure,
effete in one generation. The small man drank, most
distinctly and disagreeably he drank. He might have
been the wreck of saloon bars, or of the frequent convivial
cocktail, or of savage, solitary drinking.</p>

<p>The lady seemed to be traveling under Tarbuck's
awful wing, while the outrageous Binky wandered conspicuously
and somewhat mysteriously under hers. She
was attentive to the small man and peeled his peaches
for him, while the large man, smiling largely and with
irrepressible affection, peeled hers. The large man
(flagrantly opulent) had ordered peaches. He supposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
they'd be the one thing that durned hotel hadn't
got.</p>

<p>Thesiger conceived a violent hatred for him and for
the small man, too. He always had hated the male
of the American species. He looked on him as a disagreeable
and alien creature; at his best a creature of
predatory instincts who appropriated and monopolized
all those things of power and beauty that belonged,
properly speaking, to his betters; at his worst a defiler
of the sacred wells, a murderer and mutilator of the
language, of his, Oscar Thesiger's, language.</p>

<p>The two were murdering it now, the large man with
a terrible slow assurance in the operation; the small
man, as it were, worrying it between his teeth, disposing
of it in little savage snaps and jerks and nasal
snarlings. He would stop eating to do it. That was
when his beautiful and hypothetical companion left
him to himself.</p>

<p>For the lady had a curiously soothing and subduing
effect on the small man. Sometimes, when his snarls
were too obtrusive, she would put out her hand, her
small, perfect hand, and touch his sleeve, and he would
cease snarling and begin to peck feebly at the things
before him, or at the things before her, as the case
might be. Thesiger actually saw her transferring the
<i>entr&eacute;e</i> she had just tasted from her own plate to his;
he heard her coaxing and cajoling him, calling on him
by his offensive name of Binky. "Eat, little Binky!
Little Binky, eat!"</p>

<p>There seemed to be some rule in a game they had,
by which, if she first touched or tasted anything, Binky
could not honorably refuse it.</p>

<p>It was clear that she had a hold on the small man.
Thesiger had noticed that when she cancelled his orders
for drinks he made no resistance, while he bitterly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
resented Mr. Tarbuck's efforts at control. She would
then inquire gaily of Mr. Tarbuck whether he was in
command of this expedition or was she?</p>

<p>To-night, her fine eyes being considerably occupied
with Thesiger, the small man asserted his independence
and was served, surreptitiously as it were, with a brimming
whisky and soda.</p>

<p>He had got his hand on it when the lady shot out a
sudden arm across the table, and with a staggering
dexterity and impudence possessed herself of his glass.
Over the rim of it she kept her eyes on him, narrowed
eyes, darting mockery of Binky under half-closed lids;
and, with her head tilted back, she drank; she drank
daintily, about an inch down, and then she gave the
glass to the large man, and he, as if honor and chivalry
compelled him also, emptied it.</p>

<p>"Did you that time, Binky," she murmured.</p>

<p>Thesiger heard her. She was looking at him, obviously
to see how his fastidiousness had taken it. She
leaned forward, her elbows on the table, and her head,
propped on her hands, tilted slightly backward, and
she gazed at him under her lowered eyelids with her
narrowed, darting eyes. Then suddenly she lowered
her chin and opened her eyes, and he met them full.</p>

<p>Her gaze, which had first fascinated, now excited
him; very curiously it excited him, seeing that he was
thinking about Vera Walters all the time. So unabashed
it was, and so alluring, it sent such challenge
and encouragement to the adventurous blood, that
under it the passion that Vera would have none of
detached itself from Vera with a fierce revulsion, and
was drawn and driven, driven and drawn toward that
luminous and invincible gaze. And Thesiger began to
say to himself that the world was all before him, although
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
for him Vera had walked out of it; that he was
a man of the world; and that he didn't care.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that the beautiful American smiled
again at him. Then she got up, and swept down the
dining-hall, swinging her rosy draperies. The two men
followed her, and Thesiger was left alone in that vast
place, seated at his table, and staring into a half-empty
wineglass, to the embarrassment of the waiter who
hovered by his chair.</p>

<p>After all, she left him an ultimate scruple; he could
not altogether trust his doubt.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>It was a fine night, and the lounge was almost deserted.
Thesiger, searching it for some one he could
speak to, counted four old ladies and their middle-aged
companions, three young governesses and their
charges only less young, and one old gentleman, fixed
by an extreme corpulence in his armchair, asleep over
<i>Le Figaro</i>, while one ponderous hand retained upon his
knee <i>Le Petit Journal</i>. Nowhere any sign of the transatlantic
mystery and her companions. It occurred to
Thesiger that it might interest him to know her name
(he hadn't heard it), and even the number of her
room.</p>

<p>He strolled to the racks on each side of the great
staircase where the visitors' names were posted, and
after a prolonged investigation he came upon the three:
Miss Roma Lennox, Mr. Frank Bingham-Booker, and
Mr. Theobald G. Tarbuck, of New York City, U. S. A.
Their respective numbers were 74, 75, and 80. What
was odd, the opulent Tarbuck (number 80) occupied
a small room looking over the garage at the back,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
while 74, Mr. Frank Bingham-Booker, who was visibly
impecunious, and 75, Miss Roma Lennox, luxuriated.&mdash;Thesiger
shook his head over the social complication
and gave it up.</p>

<p>The lounge was no place for him. He went out,
down the Californie Hill and along the Avenue des
Palmiers, with some idea of turning eventually into
the Casino. He was extraordinarily uplifted. He
thought that he was feeling the enchantment of the
lucid night above the sea, the magic of the white city
of the hills, feeling the very madness of the tropics in
the illusion that she made with her palm trees and
their velvet shadows on the white pavement.</p>

<p>He had come to the little Place before the Casino,
set with plane trees. Under the electric globes the
naked stems, the branches, naked to the tip, showed
white with a livid, supernatural, a devilish and iniquitous
whiteness. The scene was further illuminated,
devilishly, iniquitously, as it were, through the doors
and windows of the Casino, of the restaurants, of the
brasseries, of the omnipresent and omnipotent American
Bar. If there were really any magic there, any
devilry, any iniquity, it joined hands with the iniquity
and devilry in Oscar Thesiger's soul, and led them forth
desirous of adventure. And walking slowly and
superbly, under the white plane trees, the adventure
came.</p>

<p>As the light fell on her superb and slow approach,
he saw that it was Roma Lennox; Roma Lennox walking,
oh Lord! by herself, like that, after ten at night,
in Cannes, on the pavement of the Place. She was
coming toward him, making straight for him, setting
herself unavoidably in his path. He had been prepared
for many things, but he had not been prepared
for that, for the publicity, the flagrance of it. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
yet he was not conscious of any wonder; rather he
had a sense of the expectedness, the foregoneness of the
event, and a savage joy in the certainty she gave him,
in his sudden absolution from the ultimate scruple,
the release from that irritating, inhibiting doubt of his
doubt.</p>

<p>He raised his hat and inquired urbanely whether he
might be permitted to walk with her a little way.</p>

<p>She had stopped and was regarding him with singular
directness.</p>

<p>"Why, certainly," she said.</p>

<p>They walked the little way permitted, and then, at
her suggestion, they sat together under the plane trees
on one of the chairs in a fairly solitary corner of the
Place.</p>

<p>He saw now that she had changed her gown and
that, over some obscurer thing, she wore a long, dull
purple coat with wide hanging sleeves; her head was
bound and wound, half-Eastern fashion, in a purple
veil, hiding her hair. In her dark garb, with all her
colors hidden, her brilliance extinguished, she was more
wonderful than ever, more than ever in keeping with
the illusion of the tropics.</p>

<p>His hands trembled and his pulses beat as he found
himself thus plunged into the heart of the adventure.
He might have been put off by the sheer rapidity and
facility of the thing, but for her serious and somber
air that seemed to open up depths, obscurities.</p>

<p>She sat very still, her profile slightly averted, and
with one raised hand she held her drifting veil close
about her chin. They sat thus in silence a moment,
for her mystery embarrassed him. Then (slowly and
superbly) over her still averted shoulder she half turned
her head toward him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," she said, "haven't you anything to say for
yourself? It's up to you."</p>

<p>Then, nervously, he began to say things, to pay her
the barefaced, far from subtle, compliments that had
served him once or twice before on similar occasions
(if any occasion could be called similar). Addressed
to her, they seemed somehow inadequate. He said
that, of course, inadequate he knew they were.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you think so," said Miss Lennox.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I said I knew it."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;the things you know!"</p>

<p>"And the things <i>you</i> know." He grew fervid.
"Don't pretend you don't know them. Don't pretend
you don't know how a man feels when he looks at
you."</p>

<p>"And why should I pretend?"</p>

<p>She had turned round now with her whole body
and faced him squarely.</p>

<p>"Why should you? Why should you?"</p>

<p>Lashed, driven as he judged she meant him to be
by her composure, his passion shook him and ran over,
from the tips of his fingers stroking the flung
sleeve of her coat, from the tip of his tongue uttering
the provoked, inevitable things&mdash;things that came
from him hushed for the crowd, but, for her, hurried,
vehement, unveiled.</p>

<p>She listened without saying one word; she listened
without looking at him, looking, rather, straight in
front of her, and tilting her head a little backward
before the approach of his inflamed, impetuous face.</p>

<p>He stopped, and she bent forward slightly and held
him with the full gaze of her serious eyes.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;do you think&mdash;you're doing?" she asked
slowly.</p>

<p>He said he supposed that she could see.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can see a good deal. I see you <i>think</i> you're saying
these things to me because you've found me here
at this peculiar time, in this peculiar place, and because
I haven't any man around."</p>

<p>"No, no. That wasn't it, I&mdash;I assure you."</p>

<p>A terrible misgiving seized him.</p>

<p>"Why did you do it?" she asked sweetly.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;upon my word, I don't know why."</p>

<p>For it seemed to him now that he really hadn't
known.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you why," said Roma Lennox. "You did
it because you were just crazy with caring for another
woman&mdash;a nice, sweet girl who won't have anything
to say to you. And you've been saying to yourself
you're durned if she cares, and you're durned if you
care. And all the time you feel so bad about it that
you must go and do something wicked right away.
And taking off your hat to me was your idea of just
about the razzlingest, dazzlingest, plumb wickedest
thing you could figure out to do."</p>

<p>He rose, and took off his hat to her again.</p>

<p>"If I did," he said, "I beg your pardon. Fact is, I&mdash;I&mdash;I
thought you were somebody else."</p>

<p>"I know it," said she, and paused. "Was it a very
strong likeness that misled you?"</p>

<p>"No. No likeness at all. It's all right," he added
hurriedly. "I'm going&mdash;I&mdash;I can't think how I made
the mistake."</p>

<p>He looked at the scene, at the nocturnal prowlers
and promenaders, at the solitary veiled and seated figure,
and he smiled. In all his agony he smiled.</p>

<p>"And yet," he said, "somebody else will be making
it if I leave you here. Somebody who won't go. I'll
go if you like, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sit down," she said; "sit down right here. <i>You</i>'re
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
not going till you and I have had a straight talk.
Don't you worry about your mistake. I <i>meant</i> you
to come up and speak to me."</p>

<p>That staggered him.</p>

<p>"Good Lord! What on earth <i>for</i>?"</p>

<p>"Because I knew that if I didn't you'd go up and
speak to somebody else. Somebody who wouldn't let
you go."</p>

<p>She was more staggering than he could have thought
her.</p>

<p>"But, dear lady, why&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Why? It's quite simple. You see, I saw you and
her together, and I took an interest&mdash;I always do take
an interest. So I watched you; and then&mdash;well&mdash;I
saw what you thought of me for watching. At first I
was just wild. And then, afterward, I said to myself
I didn't know but what I'd just as soon you <i>did</i> think
it, and then we'd have it out, and we'd see what we
could make of it between us."</p>

<p>"Make of it?" he breathed.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I suppose you'll have to make something
of it, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Between us?" He smiled faintly.</p>

<p>"Between us. I suppose if I've made you feel like
that I've got to help you."</p>

<p>"To help <i>me</i>?"</p>

<p>"To help anyone who wants it.&mdash;You don't mind if
I keep on looking at the Casino instead of looking at
you? I can talk just the same.&mdash;And then, you see, it
was because of me she left you&mdash;by the one-forty-four
train."</p>

<p>"Because of you?"</p>

<p>"Because of the way you looked at me last night.
She saw you."</p>

<p>He remembered.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>"She saw that you thought I wasn't straight; and
she saw that that was what interested you."</p>

<p>"Ah," he cried. "I was a cad. Why don't you tell
me so? Why don't you pitch into me?"</p>

<p>"Because I fancy you've got about enough to bear.
You see, I saw it all, and I was so sorry&mdash;so sorry."</p>

<p>She left it there a moment for him to take it in, her
beautiful, astounding sorrow.</p>

<p>"And I just wanted to start right in and help you."</p>

<p>He murmured something incoherent, something that
made her smile.</p>

<p>"Oh, it wasn't for the sake of <i>your</i> fine eyes, Mr.
I-don't-know-your-name. It was because of her. I
could see her saying to her dear little self, 'That woman
isn't straight. He isn't straight, either. He won't do.'
That's the sort of man she thought you were."</p>

<p>"But it wasn't as if she didn't know me, as if she
didn't care. She did care."</p>

<p>"She did, indeed."</p>

<p>"Then why," he persisted, "why did she leave me?"</p>

<p>"Don't you understand?" (Her voice went all thick
and tender in her throat.) "She was thinking of the
children. You couldn't see her with those teeny, teeny
things, and not know that's what she would think of."</p>

<p>"But," he wailed, "it wasn't as if they were her own
children."</p>

<p>"Oh, how stupid you are! It was her own children
she <i>was</i> thinking of."</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>"So that was her reason," he said presently.</p>

<p>"Of course. Of course. It's the reason for the whole
thing. It's the reason why, when a young man like
you sees a young woman like me&mdash;I mean like the lady
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
you thought I was&mdash;in an over-stimulating and tempestuous
place like this, instead of taking off his silly
hat to her, he should jam it well down over his silly
ears and&mdash;quit!"</p>

<p>"You keep on saying 'what I thought you were.' I
can't think how I could, or why I did."</p>

<p>"I know why," she replied serenely. "You fancied
I had more decorations in my back hair than a respectable
woman can well carry."</p>

<p>She meditated.</p>

<p>"I thought I could afford a rose or two. But it
seems I couldn't."</p>

<p>"You? You can afford anything&mdash;anything. All
the same&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, if I can afford to sit with you, out here, at a
quarter past ten, on this old heathenish piazza, I suppose
I can."</p>

<p>"All the same&mdash;&mdash;" he insisted.</p>

<p>She meditated again.</p>

<p>"All the same, if it wasn't those roses, I can't think
what it was."</p>

<p>"Dear lady, it wasn't the roses. You are so deadly
innocent I think I ought to tell you what it was."</p>

<p>"Do," she said.</p>

<p>"It was, really, it was seeing you here, walking by
yourself. It's so jolly late, you know."</p>

<p>She drew herself up. "An American woman can
walk anywhere, at any time."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, of course, of course. But for ordinary
people, and in Latin countries, it's considered&mdash;well,
a trifle singular."</p>

<p>She smiled.</p>

<p>"You puzzle me," he said. "Just now you seemed
perfectly aware of it. And yet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>And</i> yet?" she raised her eyebrows.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>"And yet, well&mdash;here you are, you know."</p>

<p>"Here I am, and here I've got to stay, it seems. Well&mdash;before
that?"</p>

<p>"Before that?"</p>

<p>"Before this?" She tapped her foot, impatient at
the slow movement of his thought. "Up there in the
hotel?"</p>

<p>"Oh, in the hotel. I suppose it was seeing you
with&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was positively terrible, the look with which she
faced him now. But his idea was that he had got
to help her (hadn't she helped him?), and he was
going through with it. It was permissible; it was even
imperative, seeing the lengths, the depths, rather, of
intimacy that they had gone to.</p>

<p>"Those two," he said. "They don't seem exactly
your sort."</p>

<p>"You mean," said she, "they are not exactly yours."</p>

<p>She felt the shudder of his unspoken "Heaven forbid!"</p>

<p>"I suppose," she continued, "if a European man sees
any woman alone in <a class="corr" name="TC_2" id="TC_2" title="an">a</a> hotel with two men whom he
can't size up right away as her blood relations, he's apt
to think things. Well, for all you know, Mr. Tarbuck
might be my uncle and Mr. Bingham-Booker my half-brother."</p>

<p>"But they aren't."</p>

<p>"No. As far as blood goes, they aren't any more to
me than Adam. You have me there."</p>

<p>There was a long pause which Thesiger, for the life
of him, could not fill.</p>

<p>"Well," she reverted, "Mr. Whoever-you-are, I don't
know that I owe you an explanation&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You don't owe me anything."</p>

<p>"All the same I'm going to give you one, so that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
next time you'll think twice before you make any more
of your venerable European mistakes. It isn't every
woman who'd know how to turn them to your advantage.
Perhaps you've seen what's wrong with Mr.
Bingham-Booker?"</p>

<p>He intimated that it was not practicable not to see.
"If I may say so, that makes it all the more unfitting&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's all you know about it, Mr.&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thesiger," he supplied.</p>

<p>"Mr. Thesiger. That boy had to be taken care of.
He was killing himself with drink before we came away.
He'd had a shock to his nerves, that's what brought it
on. He was ordered to Europe as his one chance.
Somebody had to go with him, somebody he'd mind,
and there wasn't anybody he <i>did</i> mind but me. I've
known him since he was a little thing in knickerbockers,
that high. So we fixed it that I was to go out and
look after Binky, and Binky's mother&mdash;he's her only
son&mdash;was coming out too, to look after me. We cared
for appearances as much as you do. Well, the day
before we sailed her married daughter was taken sick,
in the inconsiderate way that married daughters have,
and she couldn't go. And, do you know, there wasn't
a woman that could take her place. They were afraid,
every one of them, because they knew." She lowered
her voice to utter it. "It makes him mad."</p>

<p>"My dear lady, it was a job for a trained nurse."</p>

<p>"Trained nurse? They couldn't afford one. And we
didn't want a uniform hanging around and rubbing it
into the poor boy and everybody else that he was an
incurable dipsomaniac."</p>

<p>"But you&mdash;<i>you</i>?"</p>

<p>"It was my job. You don't suppose I was going
back on them?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>She faced him with it, and as he looked at her he
took the measure of her magnificence, her brilliant
bravery.</p>

<p>"Going back on <i>him</i>? Poor Binky, he was so good
and dear&mdash;except for that. You never saw anything
so cute. Up to all sorts of monkey-shines and beautiful
surprises. And then"&mdash;she smiled with a tender
irony&mdash;"he gave us <i>this</i> surprise." From her face you
could not have gathered how far from beautiful his
last had been. "I was going to see that boy through
if I had to go with him alone. I said to myself there
are always people around who'll think things, whatever
you do, but it doesn't matter what people who
don't matter think. And then&mdash;Mr. Tarbuck wouldn't
let me go alone. He said I'd have to have a man with
me. A strong man. He'd known me&mdash;never mind
how long&mdash;so it was all right. I don't know what I'd
have done without Mr. Tarbuck."</p>

<p>She paused on him.</p>

<p>"That man, whom you don't think fit for me to
have around, is&mdash;well&mdash;he's the finest man I've ever
known or want to know. He does the dearest things."</p>

<p>She paused again, remembering them. And Thesiger,
though her admiration of Tarbuck was obscurely
hateful to him, owned that, fine as she was, she was
at her finest as she praised him.</p>

<p>"Why," she went on, "just because Binky couldn't
afford a good room he gave him his. He said the view
of the sea would set him up better than anything, and
the garage was all the view <i>he</i> wanted, because he's
just crazy on motors. And he's been like that all
through. Never thought of himself once."</p>

<p>"Oh, didn't he?" said Thesiger.</p>

<p>"Not once. Do you know, Mr. Tarbuck is a very big
man. He runs one of the biggest businesses in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
States; and at twenty-four hours' notice he left his big
business to take care of itself, and came right away
on this trip to take care of me."</p>

<p>"Is he taking care of you now?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;if he can leave you&mdash;here&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Why, he's here somewhere, looking for Mr. Bingham-Booker.
He's routing about in those queer
saloons and places."</p>

<p>"And you?"</p>

<p>"I'm keeping my eye on the Casino. It's my fault
he got away. You can't always tell when it's best to
give him his head and when it isn't. I ought to have
let him have that whiskey and soda. Do you see
either of them?"</p>

<p>He looked round. "I think," he said, "I see Mr.
Tarbuck."</p>

<p>She followed his gaze. Not five yards from them,
planted on the pavement as if he grew there, was Mr.
Tarbuck. His large back was turned to them with an
expression at once ostentatious and discreet. Thesiger
had the idea that it had been there for some considerable
time, probably ever since his own appearance. Mr.
Tarbuck's back said plainly that, though Mr. Tarbuck
neither looked nor listened, that he would scorn
the action, yet he was there, at his friend's service if
she wanted him.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid," said Roma Lennox, "he hasn't found
him."</p>

<p>"He doesn't seem to be looking."</p>

<p>(He didn't.)</p>

<p>"Oh, I fancy," said she, "he's just squinting round."</p>

<p>"Can I do anything?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, you could sit here and watch the Casino
while I go and speak to Mr. Tarbuck."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>She went and spoke to him. Thesiger saw how affectionately
the large man bent his head to her.</p>

<p>She returned to Thesiger, and Mr. Tarbuck (whom
she had evidently released from sentry-go) stalked
across the Place toward the American Bar.</p>

<p>"He is not in the Casino," she said.</p>

<p>"Have you tried the American Bar?"</p>

<p>"Of course; we've tried all of them."</p>

<p>"I say, I want to help you. Can't I?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"If I stayed on in the hotel, could I be of any use?"</p>

<p>"You're not going to stay."</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't I? I've nothing else to do."</p>

<p>"Oh, haven't you? What <i>you</i> have to do is to take
that one-forty-four train to Nice, to-morrow afternoon."</p>

<p>"It's no good," he muttered gloomily. "I'm done for.
You've made me see that plain enough."</p>

<p>"All I made you see was why she turned you down.
And now that you do see&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What difference does it make, my seeing it?"</p>

<p>"Why, all the difference. Do you think I'd have
taken all this trouble if it wasn't for that&mdash;to have
you go right away and make it up with her?"</p>

<p>"And with you&mdash;can I ever make it up?"</p>

<p>"Don't you worry."</p>

<p>She rose. "I suppose appearances were against me;
but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She held him for a moment with her eyes that measured
him; then, as if she had done all that she wanted
with him, she gave him back to himself, the finer for
her handling.</p>

<p>"It wasn't for appearances you really cared."</p>

<hr class="w25" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>The publishers told you he behaved badly, did they?
They didn't know the truth about the "Wrackham
Memoirs."</p>

<p>You may well wonder how Grevill Burton got mixed
up with them, how he ever could have known Charles
Wrackham.</p>

<p>Well, he did know him, pretty intimately, too, but
it was through Antigone, and because of Antigone, and
for Antigone's adorable sake. We never called her
anything but Antigone, though Angelette was the name
that Wrackham, with that peculiar shortsightedness of
his, had given to the splendid creature.</p>

<p>Why Antigone? You'll see why.</p>

<p>No, I don't mean that Wrackham murdered his
father and married his mother; but he wouldn't have
stuck at either if it could have helped him to his
literary ambition. And every time he sat down to
write a book he must have been disgusting to the immortal
gods. And Antigone protected him.</p>

<p>She was the only living child he'd had, or, as Burton
once savagely said, was ever likely to have. And I
can tell you that if poor Wrackham's other works had
been one half as fine as Antigone it would have been
glory enough for Burton to have edited him. For he
<i>did</i> edit him.</p>

<p>They met first, if you'll believe it, at Ford Lankester's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
funeral. I'd gone to Chenies early with young
Furnival, who was "doing" the funeral for his paper,
and with Burton, who knew the Lankesters, as I did,
slightly. I'd had a horrible misgiving that I should
see Wrackham there; and there he was, in the intense
mourning of that black cloak and slouch hat he used
to wear. The cloak was a fine thing as far as it went,
and with a few more inches he really might have
carried it off; but those few more inches were just what
had been denied him. Still, you couldn't miss him or
mistake him. He was exactly like his portraits in the
papers; you know the haggard, bilious face that would
have been handsome if he'd given it a chance; the
dark, straggling, and struggling beard, the tempestuous,
disheveled look he had, and the immortal Attitude.
He was standing in it under a yew tree looking
down into Lankester's grave. It was a small white
chamber about two feet square&mdash;enough for his ashes.
The earth at the top of it was edged with branches of
pine and laurel.</p>

<p>Furnival said afterward you could see what poor
Wrackham was thinking of. <i>He</i> would have pine
branches. Pine would be appropriate for the stormy
Child of Nature that he was. And laurel&mdash;there would
have to be lots of laurel. He was at the height of his
great vogue, the brief popular fury for him that was
absurd then and seems still more absurd to-day, now
that we can measure him. He takes no room, no room
at all, even in the popular imagination; less room than
Lankester's ashes took&mdash;or his own, for that matter.</p>

<p>Yes, I know it's sad in all conscience. But Furnival
seemed to think it funny then, for he called my attention
to him. I mustn't miss him, he said.</p>

<p>Perhaps I might have thought it funny too if it
hadn't been for Antigone. I was not prepared for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
Antigone. I hadn't realized her. She was there beside
her father, not looking into the grave, but looking at
him as if she knew what he was thinking and found it,
as we find it now, pathetic. But unbearably pathetic.</p>

<p>Somehow there seemed nothing incongruous in <i>her</i>
being there. No, I can't tell you what she was like
to look at, except that she was like a great sacred,
sacrificial figure; she might have come there to pray,
or to offer something, or to pour out a libation. She
was tall and grave, and gave the effect of something
white and golden. In her <a class="corr" name="TC_3" id="TC_3" title="glack">black</a> gown and against the
yew trees she literally shone.</p>

<p>It was because of Antigone that I went up and spoke
to him, and did it (I like to think I did it now) with
reverence. He seemed, in spite of the reverence, to be
a little dashed at seeing <i>me</i> there. His idea, evidently,
was that if so obscure a person as I could be present,
it diminished <i>his</i> splendor and significance.</p>

<p>He inquired (for hope was immortal in him) whether
I was there for the papers? I said no, I wasn't there
for anything. I had come down with Burton, because
we&mdash;&mdash; But he interrupted me.</p>

<p>"What's <i>he</i> doing here?" he said. There was the
funniest air of resentment and suspicion about him.</p>

<p>I reminded him that Burton's "Essay on Ford
Lankester" had given him a certain claim. Besides,
Mrs. Lankester had asked him. He was one of the
few she had asked. I really couldn't tell him she had
asked me.</p>

<p>His gloom was awful enough when he heard that
Burton had been asked. You see, the fact glared, and
even he must have felt it&mdash;that he, with his tremendous,
his horrific vogue, had not achieved what Grevill
Burton had by his young talent. He had never known
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
Ford Lankester. Goodness knows I didn't mean to
rub it into him; but there it was.</p>

<p>We had moved away from the edge of the grave (I
think he didn't like to be seen standing there with me)
and I begged him to introduce me to his daughter.
He did so with an alacrity which I have since seen was
anything but flattering to me, and left me with her
while he made what you might call a dead set at
Furnival. He had had his eye on him and on the other
representatives of the press all the time he had been
talking to me. Now he made straight for him; when
Furnival edged off he followed; when Furnival dodged
he doubled; he was so afraid that Furnival might miss
him. As if Furnival could have missed him, as if in
the face of Wrackham's vogue his paper would have
let him miss him. It would have been as much as
Furny's place on it was worth.</p>

<p>Of course that showed that Wrackham ought never
to have been there; but there he was; and when you
think of the unspeakable solemnity and poignancy of
the occasion it really is rather awful that the one vivid
impression I have left of it is of Charles Wrackham;
Charles Wrackham under the yew tree; Charles Wrackham
leaning up against a pillar (he remained standing
during the whole of the service in the church) with his
arm raised and his face hidden in his cloak. The attitude
this time was immense. Furnival (Furny was
really dreadful) said it was "Brother mourning
Brother." But I caught him&mdash;I caught him three
times&mdash;just raising his near eyelid above his drooped
arm and peeping at Furnival and the other pressmen
to see that they weren't missing him.</p>

<p>It must have been then that Burton saw, though he
says now he didn't. He won't own up to having seen
him. We had hidden ourselves behind the mourners
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
in the chancel and he swears that he didn't see anybody
but Antigone, and that he only saw her because,
in spite of her efforts to hide too, she stood out so;
she was so tall, so white and golden. Her head was
bowed with&mdash;well, with grief, I think, but also with
what I've no doubt now was a sort of shame. I wondered:
Did she share her father's illusion? Or had
she seen through it? Did she see the awful absurdity
of the draped figure at her side? Did she realize the
gulf that separated him from the undying dead? Did
she know that we couldn't have stood his being there
but for our certainty that somewhere above us and yet
with us, from his high seat among the Undying, Ford
Lankester was looking on and enjoying more than we
could enjoy&mdash;with a divine, immortal mirth&mdash;the rich,
amazing comedy of him. Charles Wrackham there&mdash;at
<i>his</i> funeral!</p>

<p>But it wasn't till it was all over that he came out
really strong. We were sitting together in the parlor
of the village inn, he and Antigone, and Grevill Burton
and Furnival and I, with an hour on our hands before
our train left. I had ordered tea on Antigone's account,
for I saw that she was famished. They had
come down from Devonshire that day. They had got
up at five to catch the early train from Seaton Junction,
and then they'd made a dash across London for
the 12.30 from Marylebone; and somehow they'd either
failed or forgotten to lunch. Antigone said she hadn't
cared about it. Anyhow, there she was with us. We
were all feeling that relief from nervous tension which
comes after a funeral. Furnival had his stylo out and
was jotting down a few impressions. Wrackham had
edged up to him and was sitting, you may say, in
Furny's pocket while he explained to us that his weak
health would have prevented him from coming, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
that <i>he had to come</i>. He evidently thought that the
funeral couldn't have taken place without him&mdash;not
with any decency, you know. And then Antigone said
a thing for which I loved her instantly.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> oughtn't to have come," she said. "I felt all the
time I oughtn't. I hadn't any right."</p>

<p>That drew him.</p>

<p>"You had your right," he said. "You are your
father's daughter."</p>

<p>He brooded somberly.</p>

<p>"It was not," he said, "what I had expected&mdash;that
meager following. Who <i>were</i> there? Not two&mdash;not
three&mdash;and there should have been an army of us."</p>

<p>He squared himself and faced the invisible as if he
led the van.</p>

<p>That and his attitude drew Burton down on to him.</p>

<p>"Was there ever an army," he asked dangerously,
"of 'us'?"</p>

<p>Wrackham looked at Burton (it was the first time
he'd taken the smallest notice of him) with distinct
approval, as if the young man had suddenly shown
more ability than he had given him credit for. But
you don't suppose he'd seen the irony in him. Not
he!</p>

<p>"You're right," he said. "Very right. All the same,
there ought to have been more there besides Myself."</p>

<p>There was a perfectly horrible silence, and then
Antigone's voice came through it, pure and fine and
rather slow.</p>

<p>"There couldn't be. There couldn't really be anybody&mdash;there&mdash;<i>at
all</i>. He stood alone."</p>

<p>And with her wonderful voice there went a look, a
look of intelligence, as wonderful, as fine and pure.
It went straight to Burton. It was humble, and yet
there was a sort of splendid pride about it. And there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
was no revolt, mind you, no disloyalty in it; the beauty
of the thing was that it didn't set her father down;
it left him where he was, as high as you please, as
high as his vogue could lift him. Ford Lankester was
beyond him only because he was beyond them all.</p>

<p>And yet we wondered how he'd take it.</p>

<p>He took it as if Antigone had been guilty of a social
blunder; as if her behavior had been in some way painful
and improper. That's to say he took no notice of
it at all beyond shifting his seat a little so as to screen
her. And then he spoke&mdash;exclusively to us.</p>

<p>"I came," he said, "partly because I felt that, for all
Lankester's greatness, <i>this</i>&mdash;" (his gesture indicated us
all sitting there in our mourning)&mdash;"<i>this</i> was the last
of him. It's a question whether he'll ever mean much
to the next generation. There's no doubt that he
limited his public&mdash;wilfully. He alienated the many.
And, say what you like, the judgment of posterity is
not the judgment of the few." There was a faint murmur
of dissent (from Furnival), but Wrackham's
voice, which had gathered volume, rolled over it. "Not
for the novelist. Not for the painter of contemporary
life."</p>

<p>He would have kept it up interminably on those
lines and on that scale, but that Antigone created a
diversion (I think she did it on purpose to screen him)
by getting up and going out softly into the porch of
the inn.</p>

<p>Burton followed her there.</p>

<p>You forgive many things to Burton. I have had to
forgive his cutting me out with Antigone. He <i>says</i>
that they talked about nothing but Ford Lankester
out there, and certainly as I joined them I heard Antigone
saying again, "I oughtn't to have come. I only
came because I adored him." I heard Burton say,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
"And you never knew him?" and Antigone, "No, how
<i>could</i> I?"</p>

<p>And then I saw him give it back to her with his
young radiance. "It's a pity. He would have adored
<i>you</i>."</p>

<p>He always says it was Ford Lankester that did it.</p>

<p>The next thing Furnival's article came out. Charles
Wrackham's name was in it all right, and poor Antigone's.
I'm sure it made her sick to see it there.
Furny had been very solemn and decorous in his
article; but in private his profanity was awful. He
said it only remained now for Charles Wrackham
to die.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>He didn't die. Not then, not all at once. He had
an illness afterward that sent his circulation up to I
don't know what, but he didn't die of it. He knew
his business far too well to die then. We had five
blessed years of him. Nor could we have done with
less. Words can't describe the joy he was to us, nor
what he would have been but for Antigone.</p>

<p>I ought to tell you that he recovered his spirits
wonderfully on our way back from Chenies. He had
mistaken our attentions to Antigone for interest in
<i>him</i>, and he began to unbend, to unfold himself, to
expand gloriously. It was as if he felt that the removal
of Ford Lankester had left him room.</p>

<p>He proposed that Burton and I should make a pilgrimage
some day to Wildweather Hall. He called it a
pilgrimage&mdash;to the shrine, you understand.</p>

<p>Well, we made it. We used to make many pilgrimages,
but Burton made more than I.</p>

<p>The Sacred Place, you remember, was down in East
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
Devon. He'd built himself a modern Tudor mansion&mdash;if
you know what that is&mdash;there and ruined the most
glorious bit of the coast between Seaton and Sidmouth.
It stood at the head of a combe looking to the
sea. They'd used old stone for the enormous front
of it, and really, if he'd stuck it anywhere else, it might
have been rather fine. But it was much too large
for the combe. Why, when all the lights were lit in
it you could see it miles out to sea, twinkling away
like the line of the Brighton Parade. It was one
immense advertisement of Charles Wrackham, and
must have saved his publishers thousands. His
"grounds" went the whole length of the combe, and
up the hill on the east side of it where his cucumber
frames blazed in the sun. And besides his cucumbers
(anybody can have cucumbers) he had a yacht swinging
in Portland Harbor (at least he had that year
when he was at his height). And he had two motor-cars
and a wood that he kept people out of, and a great
chunk of beach. He couldn't keep them off that, and
they'd come miles, from Torquay and Exeter, to snapshot
him when he bathed.</p>

<p>The regular approach to him, for pilgrims, was extraordinarily
impressive. And not only the "grounds,"
but the whole interior of the Tudor mansion, must
have been planned with a view to that alone. It was
all staircases and galleries and halls, black oak darknesses
and sudden clear spaces and beautiful chintzy,
silky rooms&mdash;lots of them, for Mrs. Wrackham&mdash;and
books and busts and statues everywhere. And these
were only his outer courts; inside them was his sanctuary,
his library, and inside that, divided from it by
curtains, was the Innermost, the shrine itself, and
inside the shrine, veiled by his curtains, was Charles
Wrackham.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>As you came through, everything led up to him, as
it were, by easy stages and gradations. He didn't burst
on you cruelly and blind you. You waited a minute
or two in the library, which was all what he called
"silent presences and peace." The silent presences,
you see, prepared you for him. And when, by gazing
on the busts of Shakespeare and Cervantes, your mind
was turned up to him, then you were let in. Over
that Tudor mansion, and the whole place, you may
say for miles along the coast, there brooded the shadow
of Charles Wrackham's greatness. If we hadn't been
quite so much oppressed by that we might have enjoyed
the silent presences and the motor-cars and
things, and the peace that was established there because
of him. And we did enjoy Antigone and Mrs.
Wrackham.</p>

<p>It's no use speculating what he would have been if
he'd never written anything. You cannot detach him
from his writings, nor would he have wished to be detached.
I suppose he would still have been the innocent,
dependent creature that he was: fond, very fond
of himself, but fond also of his home and of his wife
and daughter. It was his domesticity, described, illustrated,
exploited in a hundred papers, that helped to
endear Charles Wrackham to his preposterous public.
It was part of the immense advertisement. His wife's
gowns, the sums he spent on her, the affection that he
notoriously lavished on her, were part of it.</p>

<p>I'll own that at one time I had a great devotion
to Mrs. Wrackham (circumstances have somewhat
strained it since). She was a woman of an adorable
plumpness, with the remains of a beauty which
must have been pink and golden once. And she would
have been absolutely simple but for the touch of
assurance that was given her by her position as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
publicly loved wife of a great man. Every full, round
line of her face and figure declared (I don't like to say
advertised) her function. She existed in and for
Charles Wrackham. You saw that her prominent
breast fairly offered itself as a pillow for his head. Her
soft hands suggested the perpetual stroking and soothing
of his literary vanity, her face the perpetual blowing
of an angelic trumpet in his praise. Her entire
person, incomparably soft, yet firm, was a buffer that
interposed itself automatically between Wrackham and
the bludgeonings of fate. As for her mind, I know
nothing about it except that it was absolutely simple.
She was a woman of one idea&mdash;two ideas, I should say,
Charles Wrackham the Man, and Charles Wrackham
the Great Novelist.</p>

<p>She could separate them only so far as to marvel
at his humanity because of his divinity, how he could
stoop, how he could condescend, how he could lay it
all aside and be delightful as we saw him&mdash;"Like a
boy, Mr. Simpson, like a boy!"</p>

<p>It was our second day, Sunday, and Wrackham had
been asleep in his shrine all afternoon while she piloted
us in the heat about the "grounds." I can see her
now, dear plump lady, under her pink sunshade, saying
all this with a luminous, enchanting smile. We
were not to miss him; we were to look at him giving
up his precious, his inconceivably precious time, laying
himself out to amuse, to entertain us&mdash;"Just giving
himself&mdash;giving himself all the time." And then, lest
we might be uplifted, she informed us, still with the
luminous, enchanting smile, that Mr. Wrackham was
like that to "everybody, Mr. Simpson; everybody!"</p>

<p>She confided a great many things to us that afternoon.
For instance, that she was greatly troubled by
what she called "the ill-natured attacks on Mr. Wrackham
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
in the papers," the "things" that "They" said
about him (it was thus vaguely that she referred to
some of our younger and profaner critics). She was
very sweet and amiable and charitable about it. I
believe she prayed for them. She was quite sure, dear
lady, that "They" wouldn't do it if "They" knew how
sensitive he was, how much it hurt him. And of
course it didn't really hurt him. He was above it all.</p>

<p>I remember I began that Sunday by cracking up
Burton to her, just to see how she would take it, and
perhaps for another reason. Antigone had carried him
off to the strawberry-bed, where I gathered from their
sounds of happy laughter that they were feeding each
other with the biggest ones. For the moment, though
not, I think, afterward, Antigone's mother was blind
and deaf to what was going on in the strawberry-bed.
I spoke to her of Burton and his work, of the essay on
Ford Lankester, of the brilliant novel he had just published,
his first; and I even went so far as to speak
of the praise it had received; but I couldn't interest
her in Burton. I believe she always, up to the very
last, owed Burton a grudge on account of his novels;
not so much because he had so presumptuously written
them as because he had been praised for writing
them. I don't blame her, neither did he, for this feeling.
It was inseparable from the piety with which she
regarded Charles Wrackham as a great figure in literature,
a sacred and solitary figure.</p>

<p>I don't know how I got her off him and on to Antigone.
I may have asked her point-blank to what
extent Antigone was her father's daughter. The luminous
and expansive lady under the sunshade was
a little less luminous and expansive when we came to
Angelette, as she called her; but I gathered then, and
later, that Antigone was a dedicated child, a child
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
set apart and consecrated to the service of her father.
It was not, of course, to be expected that she should
inherit any of his genius; Mrs. Wrackham seemed to
think it sufficiently wonderful that she should have
developed the intelligence that fitted her to be his
secretary. I was not to suppose it was because he
couldn't afford a secretary (the lady laughed as she
said this; for you see how absurd it was, the idea of
Charles Wrackham not being able to afford anything).
It was because they both felt that Antigone ought not
to be, as she put it, "overshadowed" by him; he
wished that she should be associated, intimately associated,
with his work; that the child should have her
little part in his glory. It was not only her share of
life which he took and so to speak put in the bank
for her, but an investment for Antigone in the big
business of his immortality. There she was, there she
always would be, associated with Charles Wrackham
and his work.</p>

<p>She sighed under the sunshade. "That child," she
said, "can do more for him, Mr. Simpson, than I can."</p>

<p>I could see that, though the poor lady didn't know
it, she suffered a subtle sorrow and temptation. If
she hadn't been so amiable, if she hadn't been so good,
she would have been jealous of Antigone.</p>

<p>She assured us that only his wife and daughter
knew what he really was.</p>

<p>We wondered, did Antigone know? She made no
sign of distance or dissent, but somehow she didn't
seem to belong to him. There was something remote
and irrelevant about her; she didn't fit into the advertisement.
And in her remoteness and irrelevance
she remained inscrutable. She gave no clue to what
she really thought of him. When "They" went for him
she soothed him. She spread her warm angel's wing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
and wrapped him from the howling blast. But, as far
as we could make out, she never committed herself
to an opinion. All her consolations went to the tune
of "They say. What say they? Let them say."
Which might have applied to anybody. We couldn't
tell whether, like her mother, she believed implicitly
or whether she saw through him.</p>

<p>She certainly saw beyond him, or she couldn't have
said the things she did&mdash;you remember?&mdash;at Ford
Lankester's funeral. But she had been overwrought
then, and that clear note had been wrung from her
by the poignancy of the situation. She never gave us
anything like that again.</p>

<p>And she was devoted to him&mdash;devoted with passion.
There couldn't be any sort of doubt about it.</p>

<p>Sometimes I wondered even then if it wasn't almost
entirely a passion of pity. For she must have known.
Burton always declared she knew. At least in the
beginning he did; afterwards he was not clear about
it any more than I was then. He said that her knowledge,
her vision, of him was complete and that her
pity for him was unbearable. He said that she would
have given anything to have seen him as her mother
saw him and as he saw himself, and that all her devotion
to him, to it, his terrible work, was to make up
to him for not seeing, for seeing as she saw. It was
consecration, if you like; but it was expiation too, the
sacrifice for the sin of an unfilial clarity.</p>

<p>And the tenderness she put into it!</p>

<p>Wrackham never knew how it protected him. It
regularly spoilt our pleasure in him. We couldn't&mdash;when
we thought of Antigone&mdash;get the good out of him
we might have done. We <i>had</i> to be tender to him,
too. I think Antigone liked us for our tenderness.
Certainly she liked Burton&mdash;oh, from the very first.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>They had known each other about six months when
he proposed to her, and she wouldn't have him. He
went on proposing at ridiculously short intervals, but
it wasn't a bit of good. Wrackham wouldn't give his
consent, and it seemed Antigone wouldn't marry anybody
without it. He <i>said</i> Burton was too poor, and
Antigone too young; but the real reason was that Burton's
proposal came as a shock to his vanity. I told
you how coolly he had appropriated the young man's
ardent and irrepressible devotion; he had looked on
him as a disciple, a passionate pilgrim to his shrine;
and the truth, the disillusionment, was more than he
could stand. He'd never had a disciple or a pilgrim of
Burton's quality. He could ignore and disparage Burton's
brilliance when it suited his own purpose, and
when it suited his own purpose he thrust Burton and
his brilliance down your throat. Thus he never said
a word about Burton's novels except that he once went
out of his way to tell me that he hadn't read them (I
believe he was afraid to). Antigone must have noticed
<i>that</i>, and she must have understood the meaning
of it. I know she never spoke to him about anything
that Burton did. She must have felt he couldn't bear
it. Anyhow, he wasn't going to recognize Burton's
existence as a novelist; it was as if he thought his
silence could extinguish him. But he knew all about
Burton's critical work; there was his splendid "Essay
on Ford Lankester"; he couldn't ignore or disparage
that, and he didn't want to. He had had his eye on
him from the first as a young man, an exceptionally
brilliant young man who might be useful to him.</p>

<p>And so, though he wouldn't let the brilliant young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
man marry his daughter, he wasn't going to lose sight
of him; and Burton continued his passionate pilgrimages
to Wildweather Hall.</p>

<p>I didn't see Wrackham for a long time, but I heard
of him; I heard all I wanted, for Burton was by no
means so tender to him as he used to be. And I heard
of poor Antigone. I gathered that she wasn't happy,
that she was losing some of her splendor and vitality.
In all Burton's pictures of her you could see her droop.</p>

<p>This went on for nearly three years, and by that
time Burton, as you know, had made a name for himself
that couldn't be ignored. He was also making a
modest, a rather painfully modest income. And one
evening he burst into my rooms and told me it was all
right. Antigone had come round. Wrackham hadn't,
but that didn't matter. Antigone had said she didn't
care. They might have to wait a bit, but that didn't
matter either. The great thing was that she had accepted
him, that she had had the courage to oppose her
father. You see, they scored because, as long as
Wrackham had his eye on Burton, he didn't forbid him
the house.</p>

<p>I went down with him soon after that by Wrackham's
invitation. I'm not sure that he hadn't his eye
on me; he had his eye on everybody in those days
when, you know, his vogue, his tremendous vogue, was
just perceptibly on the decline.</p>

<p>I found him changed, rather pitiably changed, and
in low spirits. "They"&mdash;the terrible, profane young
men&mdash;had been "going for him" again, as he called it.</p>

<p>Of course when they really went for him he was all
right. He could get over it by saying that they did it
out of sheer malevolence, that they were jealous of his
success, that a writer cannot be great without making
enemies, and that perhaps he wouldn't have known
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
how great he was if he hadn't made any. But they
didn't give him much opportunity. They were too
clever for that. They knew exactly how to flick him
on the raw. It wasn't by the things they said so much
as by the things they deliberately didn't say; and they
could get at him any time, easily, by praising other
people.</p>

<p>Of course none of it did any violence to the supreme
illusion. He was happy. I think he liked writing his
dreadful books. (There must have been something
soothing in the act with its level, facile fluency.) I
know he enjoyed bringing them out. He gloated over
the announcements. He drew a voluptuous pleasure
from his proofs. He lived from one day of publication
to the other; there wasn't a detail of the whole dreary
business that he would have missed. It all nourished
the illusion. I don't suppose he ever had a shadow
of misgiving as to his power. What he worried about
was his prestige. He couldn't help being aware that,
with all he had, there was still something that he
hadn't. He knew, he must have known, that he was not
read, not recognized by the people who admired Ford
Lankester. He felt their silence and their coldness strike
through the warm comfort of his vogue. We, Burton
and I, must have made him a bit uneasy. I never in
my life saw anybody so alert and so suspicious, so
miserably alive to the qualifying shade, the furtive
turn, the disastrous reservation.</p>

<p>But no, never a misgiving about Himself. Only, I
think, moments of a dreadful insight when he heard
behind him the creeping of the tide of oblivion, and it
frightened him. He was sensitive to every little fluctuation
in his vogue. He had the fear of its vanishing
before his eyes. And there he was, shut up among all
his splendor with his fear; and it was his wife's work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
and Antigone's to keep it from him, to stand between
him and that vision. He was like a child when his
terror was on him; he would go to anybody for comfort.
I believe, if Antigone and his wife hadn't been
there, he'd have confided in his chauffeur.</p>

<p>He confided now in us, walking dejectedly with us
in his "grounds."</p>

<p>"They'd destroy me," he said, "if they could. How
they can take pleasure in it, Simpson! It's incredible,
incomprehensible."</p>

<p>We said it was, but it wasn't in the least. We knew
the pleasure, the indestructible pleasure, he gave us;
we knew the irresistible temptation that he offered.
As for destroying him, we knew that they wouldn't
have destroyed him for the world. He was their one
bright opportunity. What would they have done without
their Wrackham?</p>

<p>He kept on at it. He said there had been moments
this last year when, absurd as it might seem, he had
wondered whether after all he hadn't failed. That
was the worst of an incessant persecution; it hypnotized
you into disbelief, not as to your power (he
rubbed that in), but as to your success, the permanence
of the impression you had made. I remember
trying to console him, telling him that he was all right.
He'd got his public, his enormous public.</p>

<p>There were consolations we might have offered him.
We might have told him that he <i>had</i> succeeded; we
might have told him that, if he wanted a monument,
he'd only got to look around him. After all, he'd
made a business of it that enabled him to build a
Tudor mansion with bathrooms everywhere and keep
two motor-cars. We could have reminded him that
there wasn't one of the things he'd got with it&mdash;no, not
one bathroom&mdash;that he would have sacrificed, that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
was capable of sacrificing; that he'd warmed himself
jolly well all over and all the time before the fire of
life, and that his cucumbers alone must have been a
joy to him. And of course we might have told him
that he couldn't have it both ways; that you cannot
have bathrooms and motor-cars and cucumber-frames
(not to the extent <i>he</i> had them) <i>and</i> the incorruptible
and stainless glory. But that wouldn't have consoled
him; for he wanted it both ways. Fellows like Wrackham
always do. He wasn't really happy, as a really
great man might have been, with his cucumbers and
things.</p>

<p>He kept on saying it was easy enough to destroy a
Great Name. Did they know, did anybody know, what
it cost to build one?</p>

<p>I said to myself that possibly Antigone might know.
All I said to him was, "Look here, we're agreed they
can't do anything. When a man has once captured
and charmed the great Heart of the Public, he's safe&mdash;in
his lifetime, anyway."</p>

<p>Then he burst out. "His lifetime? Do you suppose
he cares about his lifetime? It's the life beyond
life&mdash;the life beyond life."</p>

<p>It was in fact, d'you see, the "Life and Letters." He
was thinking about it then.</p>

<p>He went on. "They have it all their own way. He
can't retort; he can't explain; he can't justify himself.
It's only when he's dead they'll let him speak."</p>

<p>"Well, I mean to. That'll show 'em," he said;
"that'll show 'em."</p>

<p>"He's thinking of it, Simpson; he's thinking of it,"
Burton said to me that evening.</p>

<p>He smiled. He didn't know what his thinking of it
was going to mean&mdash;for him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>He had been thinking of it for some considerable
time. That pilgrimage was my last&mdash;it'll be two years
ago this autumn&mdash;and it was in the spring of last
year he died.</p>

<p>He was happy in his death. It saved him from the
thing he dreaded above everything, certainty of the
ultimate extinction. It has not come yet. We are
feeling still the long reverberation of his vogue. We
miss him still in the gleam, the jest gone forever from
the papers. There is no doubt but that his death
staved off the ultimate extinction. It revived the public
interest in him. It jogged the feeble pulse of his
once vast circulation. It brought the familiar portrait
back again into the papers, between the long, long
columns. And there was more laurel and a larger
crowd at Brookwood than on the day when we first met
him in the churchyard at Chenies.</p>

<p>And then we said there had been stuff in him. We
talked (in the papers) of his "output." He had been,
after all, a prodigious, a gigantic worker. He appealed
to our profoundest national instincts, to our
British admiration of sound business, of the self-made,
successful man. He might not have done anything for
posterity, but he had provided magnificently for his
child and widow.</p>

<p>So we appraised him. Then on the top of it all the
crash came, the tremendous crash that left his child
and widow almost penniless. He hadn't provided for
them at all. He had provided for nothing but his own
advertisement. He had been living, not only beyond
his income, but beyond, miles beyond, his capital, beyond
even the perennial power that was the source
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
of it. And he had been afraid, poor fellow! to retrench,
to reduce by one cucumber-frame the items of
the huge advertisement; why, it would have been as
good as putting up the shop windows&mdash;his publishers
would instantly have paid him less.</p>

<p>His widow explained tearfully how it all was, and
how wise and foreseeing he had been; what a thoroughly
sound man of business. And really we thought
the dear lady wouldn't be left so very badly off. We
calculated that Burton would marry Antigone, and
that the simple, self-denying woman could live in modest
comfort on the mere proceeds of the inevitable
sale. Then we heard that the Tudor mansion, the
"Grounds," the very cucumber-frames, were sunk in
a mortgage; and the sale of his "effects," the motor-cars
and furniture, the books and the busts, paid his
creditors in full, but it left a bare pittance for his
child and widow.</p>

<p>They had come up to town in that exalted state
with which courageous women face adversity. In her
excitement Antigone tried hard to break off her engagement
to Grevill Burton. She was going to do
typewriting, she was going to be somebody's secretary,
she was going to do a thousand things; but she was
not going to hang herself like a horrid millstone round
his neck and sink him. She had got it into her head,
poor girl, that Wrackham had killed himself, ruined
himself by his efforts to provide for his child and
widow. They had been the millstones round <i>his</i> neck.
She even talked openly now about the "pot-boilers"
they had compelled Papa to write; by which she gave
us to understand that he had been made for better
things. It would have broken your heart to hear her.</p>

<p>Her mother, ravaged and reddened by grief, met us
day after day (we were doing all we could for her)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
with her indestructible, luminous smile. She could be
tearful still on provocation, through the smile, but
there was something about her curiously casual and
calm, something that hinted almost complacently at a
little mystery somewhere, as if she had up her sleeve
resources that we were not allowing for. But we caught
the gist of it, that we, affectionate and well-meaning,
but thoroughly unbusiness-like young men, were not
to worry. Her evident conviction was that he <i>had</i>
foreseen, he <i>had</i> provided for them.</p>

<p>"Lord only knows," I said to Burton, "what the dear
soul imagines will turn up."</p>

<p>Then one day she sent for me; for me, mind you, not
Burton. There was something that she and her daughter,
desired to consult me about. I went off at once
to the dreadful little lodgings in the Fulham Road
where they had taken refuge. I found Antigone looking,
if anything, more golden and more splendid, more
divinely remote and irrelevant against the dingy background.
Her mother was sitting very upright at the
head and she at the side of the table that almost filled
the room. They called me to the chair set for me
facing Antigone. Throughout the interview I was exposed,
miserably, to the clear candor of her gaze.</p>

<p>Her mother, with the simplicity which was her
charming quality, came straight to the point. It
seemed that Wrackham had thought better of us, of
Burton and me, than he had ever let us know. He
had named us his literary executors. Of course, his
widow expounded, with the option of refusal. Her
smile took for granted that we would not refuse.</p>

<p>What did I say? Well, I said that I couldn't speak
for Burton, but for my own part I&mdash;I said I was honored
(for Antigone was looking at me with those eyes)
and of course I shouldn't think of refusing, and I didn't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
imagine Burton would either. You see I'd no idea what
it meant. I supposed we were only in for the last
piteous turning out of the dead man's drawers, the
sorting and sifting of the rubbish heap. We were to
decide what was worthy of him and what was not.</p>

<p>There couldn't, I supposed, be much of it. He had
been hard pressed. He had always published up to
the extreme limit of his production.</p>

<p>I had forgotten all about the "Life and Letters."
They had been only a fantastic possibility, a thing our
profane imagination played with; and under the serious,
chastening influences of his death it had ceased
to play.</p>

<p>And now they were telling me that this thing was
a fact. The letters were, at any rate. They had raked
them all in, to the last postcard (he hadn't written any
to us), and there only remained the Life. It wasn't a
perfectly accomplished fact; it would need editing,
filling out, and completing from where he had left it
off. He had not named his editor, his biographer, in
writing&mdash;at least, they could find no note of it among
his papers&mdash;but he had expressed a wish, a wish that
they felt they could not disregard. He had expressed
it the night before he died to Antigone, who was with
him.</p>

<p>"Did he not, dearest?"</p>

<p>I heard Antigone say, "Yes, Mamma." She was not
looking at me then.</p>

<p>There was a perfectly awful silence. And then
Antigone did look at me, and she smiled faintly.</p>

<p>"It isn't you," she said.</p>

<p>No, it was not I. I wasn't in it. It was Grevill
Burton.</p>

<p>I ought to tell you it wasn't an open secret any
longer that Burton was editing the "Life and Letters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
of Ford Lankester," with a Critical Introduction. The
announcement had appeared in the papers a day or two
before Wrackham's death. He had had his eye on
Burton. He may have wavered between him and another,
he may have doubted whether Burton was after
all good enough; but that honor, falling to Burton at
that moment, clinched it. <i>There</i> was prestige, <i>there</i>
was the thing he wanted. Burton was his man.</p>

<p>There wouldn't, Mrs. Wrackham said, be so very
much editing to do. He had worked hard in the years
before his death. He had gathered in all the material,
and there were considerable fragments&mdash;whole blocks
of reminiscences, which could be left, which <i>should</i> be
left as they stood (her manner implied that they were
monuments). What they wanted, of course, was something
more than editing. Anybody could have done
that. There was the Life to be completed in the later
years, the years in which Mr. Burton had known him
more intimately than any of his friends. Above all,
what was necessary, what had been made so necessary,
was a Critical Introduction, the summing up, the giving
of him to the world as he really was.</p>

<p>Did I think they had better approach Mr. Burton
direct, or would I do that for them? Would I sound
him on the subject?</p>

<p>I said cheerfully that I would sound him. If Burton
couldn't undertake it (I had to prepare them for this
possibility), no doubt we should find somebody who
could.</p>

<p>But Antigone met this suggestion with a clear "No."
It wasn't to be done at all unless Mr. Burton did it.
And her mother gave a little cry. It was inconceivable
that it should not be done. Mr. Burton must.
He would. He would see the necessity, the importance
of it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course <i>I</i> saw it. And I saw that my position and
Burton's was more desperate than I had imagined. I
couldn't help but see the immense importance of the
"Life and Letters." They were bound, even at this
time of day, to "fetch" a considerable sum, and the
dear lady might be pardoned if she were incidentally
looking to them as a means of subsistence. They were
evidently what she had had up her sleeve. Her delicacy
left the financial side of the question almost untouched;
but in our brief discussion of the details,
from her little wistful tone in suggesting that if Mr.
Burton could undertake it at once and get it done soon,
if they could in fact launch it on the top of the returning
tide&mdash;from the very way that she left me to finish
her phrases for her I gathered that they regarded the
"Life and Letters" as Wrackham's justification in more
ways than one. They proved that he had not left
them unprovided for.</p>

<p>Well, I sounded Burton. He stared at me aghast.
I was relieved to find that he was not going to be
sentimental about it. He refused flatly.</p>

<p>"I can't do him <i>and</i> Lankester," he said.</p>

<p>I saw his point. He would have to keep himself
clean for <i>him</i>. I said of course he couldn't, but I
didn't know how he was going to make it straight
with Antigone.</p>

<p>"I shan't have to make it straight with Antigone,"
he said. "She'll see it. She always has seen."</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>That was just exactly what I doubted.</p>

<p>I was wrong. She always had seen. And it was
because she saw and loathed herself for seeing that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
she insisted on Burton's doing this thing. It was part
of her expiation, her devotion, her long sacrificial act.
She was dragging Burton into it partly, I believe, because
he had seen too, more clearly, more profanely,
more terribly than she.</p>

<p>Oh, and there was more in it than that. I got it all
from Burton. He had been immensely plucky about
it. He didn't leave it to me to get him out of it. He
had gone to her himself, so certain was he that he
could make it straight with her.</p>

<p>And he hadn't made it straight at all. It had been
more awful, he said, than I could imagine. She hadn't
seen his point. She had refused to see it, absolutely
(I had been right there, anyhow).</p>

<p>He had said, in order to be decent, that he was too
busy; he was pledged to Lankester and couldn't possibly
do the two together. And she had seen all that.
She said of course it was a pity that he couldn't do it
now, while people were ready for her father, willing,
she said, to listen; but if it couldn't be done at once,
why, it couldn't. After all, they could afford to wait.
<i>He</i>, she said superbly, could afford it. She ignored in
her fine manner the material side of the "Life and
Letters," its absolute importance to their poor finances,
the fact that if <i>he</i> could afford to wait, <i>they</i> couldn't.
I don't think that view of it ever entered into her head.
The great thing, she said, was that it should be done.</p>

<p>And then he had to tell her that <i>he</i> couldn't do it.
He couldn't do it at all. "That part of it, Simpson,"
he said, "was horrible. I felt as if I were butchering
her&mdash;butchering a lamb."</p>

<p>But I gathered that he had been pretty firm so far,
until she broke down and cried. For she did, poor
bleeding lamb, all in a minute. She abandoned her
superb attitude and her high ground and put it altogether
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
on another footing. Her father hadn't been the
happy, satisfied, facilely successful person he was supposed
to be. People had been cruel to him; they had
never understood; they didn't realize that his work
didn't represent him. Of course she knew (she seems
to have handled this part of it with a bold sincerity)
what he, Burton, thought about it; but he did realize
<i>that</i>. He knew it didn't do him anything like justice.
He knew what lay behind it, behind everything that
he had written. It was wonderful, Burton said, how
she did that, how she made the vague phrase open up
a vast hinterland of intention, the unexplored and unexploited
spirit of him. He knew, Burton knew, how
he had felt about it, how he had felt about his fame.
It hadn't been the thing he really wanted. He had
never had that. And oh, she wanted him to have it.
It was the only thing she wanted, the only thing she
really cared about, the only thing she had ever asked
of Burton.</p>

<p>He told me frankly that she didn't seem quite sane
about it. He understood it, of course. She was broken
up by the long strain of her devotion, by his death
and by the crash afterward, by the unbearable pathos
of him, of his futility, and of the menacing oblivion.
You could see that Antigone had parted with her sense
of values and distinctions, that she had lost her bearings;
she was a creature that drifted blindly on a
boundless sea of compassion. She saw her father die
the ultimate death. She pleaded passionately with
Burton to hold back the shadow; to light a lamp for
him; to prolong, if it were only for a little while, his
memory; to give him, out of his own young radiance
and vitality, the life beyond life that he had desired.</p>

<p>Even then, so he says, he had held out, but more
feebly. He said he thought somebody else ought to do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
it, somebody who knew her father better. And she
said that nobody could do it, nobody did know him;
there was nobody's name that would give the value to
the thing that Burton's would. That was handsome of
her, Burton said. And he seems to have taken refuge
from this dangerous praise in a modesty that was absurd,
and that he knew to be absurd in a man who had
got Lankester's "Life" on his hands. And Antigone
saw through it; she saw through it at once. But she
didn't see it all; he hadn't the heart to let her see his
real reason, that he couldn't do them both. He
couldn't do Wrackham after Lankester, nor yet, for
Lankester's sake, before. And he couldn't, for his own
sake, do him at any time. It would make him too
ridiculous.</p>

<p>And in the absence of his real reason he seems to
have been singularly ineffective. He just sat there
saying anything that came into his head except the
one thing. He rather shirked this part of it; at any
rate, he wasn't keen about telling me what he'd said,
except that he'd tried to change the subject. I rather
suspected him of the extreme error of making love to
Antigone in order to keep her off it.</p>

<p>Finally she made a bargain with him. She said that
if he did it she would marry him whenever he liked
(she had considered their engagement broken off,
though he hadn't). But (there Antigone was adamant)
if he didn't, if he cared so little about pleasing
her, she wouldn't marry him at all.</p>

<p>Then he said of course he did care; he would do
anything to please her, and if she was going to take a
mean advantage and to put it that way&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>And of course she interrupted him and said he didn't
see her point; she wasn't putting it that way; she
wasn't going to take any advantage, mean or otherwise;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
it was a question of a supreme, a sacred obligation.
How <i>could</i> she marry a man who disregarded,
who was capable of disregarding, her father's dying
wish? And that she stuck to.</p>

<p>I can't tell you now whether she was merely testing
him, or whether she was determined, in pure filial piety,
to carry the thing through, and saw, knowing her hold
on him, that this was the way and the only way, or
whether she actually did believe that for him, too,
the obligation was sacred and supreme. Anyhow she
stuck to it. Poor Burton said he didn't think it was
quite fair of her to work in that way, but that, rather
than lose her, rather than lose Antigone, he had
given in.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>He had taken the papers&mdash;the documents&mdash;home
with him; and that he might know the worst, the whole
awful extent of what he was in for, he began overhauling
them at once.</p>

<p>I went to see him late one evening and found him
at it. He had been all through them once, he said,
and he was going through them again. I asked him
what they were like. He said nothing.</p>

<p>"Worse than you thought?" I asked.</p>

<p>Far worse. Worse than anything I could imagine.
It was inconceivable, he said, what they were like. I
said I supposed they were like <i>him</i>. I gathered from
his silence that it was inconceivable what <i>he</i> was. That
Wrackham should have no conception of where he
really stood was conceivable; we knew he was like that,
heaps of people were, and you didn't think a bit the
worse of them; you could present a quite respectable
"Life" of them with "Letters" by simply suppressing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
a few salient details and softening the egoism all round.
But what Burton supposed he was going to do with
Wrackham, short of destroying him! You couldn't
soften him, you couldn't tone him down; he wore thin
in the process and vanished under your touch.</p>

<p>But oh, he was immense! The reminiscences were
the best. Burton showed us some of them. This was
one:</p>

<p>"It was the savage aspects of Nature that appealed
to me. One of my earliest recollections is of a thunderstorm
among the mountains. My nursery looked
out upon the mountainside where the storm broke.
My mother has told me that I cried till I made the
nurse carry me to the window, and that I literally
leaped in her arms for joy. I laughed at the lightning
and clapped my hands at the thunder. The Genius
of the Storm was my brother. I could not have been
more than eleven months old."</p>

<p>And there was another bit that Burton said was
even better.</p>

<p>"I have been a fighter all my life. I have had many
enemies. What man who has ever done anything
worth doing has not had them? But our accounts are
separate, and I am willing to leave the ultimate reckoning
to time." There were lots of things like that.
Burton said it was like that cloak he used to wear. It
would have been so noble if only he had been a little
bigger.</p>

<p>And there was an entry in his diary that I think beat
everything he'd ever done. "May 3, 1905. Lankester
died. Finished the last chapter of 'A Son of Thunder.'
<i>Ave Frater, atque vale.</i>"</p>

<p>I thought there was a fine audacity about it, but
Burton said there wasn't. Audacity implied a consciousness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
of danger, and Wrackham had none. Burton
was in despair.</p>

<p>"Come," I said, "there must be something in the Letters."</p>

<p>No, the Letters were all about himself, and there
wasn't anything in <i>him</i>. You couldn't conceive the
futility, the fatuity, the vanity&mdash;it was a disease with
him.</p>

<p>"I couldn't have believed it, Simpson, if I hadn't
seen him empty himself."</p>

<p>"But the hinterland?" I said. "How about the
hinterland? That was what you were to have opened
up."</p>

<p>"There wasn't any hinterland. He's opened himself
up. You can see all there was of him. It's lamentable,
Simpson, lamentable."</p>

<p>I said it seemed to me to be supremely funny. And
he said I wouldn't think it funny if I were responsible
for it.</p>

<p>"But you aren't," I said. "You must drop it. You
can't be mixed up with <i>that</i>. The thing's absurd."</p>

<p>"Absurd? Absurdity isn't in it. It's infernal, Simpson,
what this business will mean to me."</p>

<p>"Look here," I said. "This is all rot. You can't go
on with it."</p>

<p>He groaned. "I <i>must</i> go on with it. If I don't&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Antigone will hang herself?"</p>

<p>"No. She won't hang herself. She'll chuck me.
That's how she has me, it's how I'm fixed. Can you
conceive a beastlier position?"</p>

<p>I said I couldn't, and that if a girl of mine put me
in it, by heaven, I'd chuck <i>her</i>.</p>

<p>He smiled. "You can't chuck Antigone," he said.</p>

<p>I said Antigone's attitude was what I didn't understand.
It was inconceivable she didn't know what the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
things were like. "What do you suppose she really
thinks of them?"</p>

<p>That was it. She had never committed herself to
an opinion. "You know," he said, "she never did."</p>

<p>"But," I argued, "you told me yourself she said
they'd represent him. And they do, don't they?"</p>

<p>"Represent him?" He grinned in his agony. "I
should think they did."</p>

<p>"But," I persisted, because he seemed to me to be
shirking the issue, "it was her idea, wasn't it? that
they'd justify him, give him his chance to speak, to
put himself straight with <i>us</i>?"</p>

<p>"She seems," he said meditatively, "to have taken
that for granted."</p>

<p>"Taken it for granted? Skittles!" I said. "She
must have seen they were impossible. I'm convinced,
Burton, that she's seen it all along; she's merely testing
you to see how you'd behave, how far you'd go for
her. You needn't worry. You've gone far enough.
She'll let you off."</p>

<p>"No," he said, "she's not testing me. I'd have seen
through her if it had been that. It's deadly serious.
It's a sacred madness with her. She'll never let me off.
She'll never let herself off. I've told you a hundred
times it's expiation. We can't get round <i>that</i>."</p>

<p>"She must be mad, indeed," I said, "not to see."</p>

<p>"See? See?" he cried. "It's my belief, Simpson,
that she hasn't seen. She's been hiding her dear little
head in the sand."</p>

<p>"How do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean," he said, "she hasn't looked. She's been
afraid to."</p>

<p>"Hasn't looked?"</p>

<p>"Hasn't read the damned things. She doesn't know
how they expose him."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then, my dear fellow," I said, "you've got to tell
her."</p>

<p>"Tell her?" he cried. "If I told her she <i>would</i> go
and hang herself. No. I'm not to tell her. I'm not
to tell anybody. She's got an idea that he's pretty
well exposed himself, and, don't you see, I'm to wrap
him up."</p>

<p>"Wrap him up&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wrap him up, so that she can't see, so that nobody
can see. <i>That's</i> what I'm here for&mdash;to edit him, Simpson,
edit him out of all recognition. She hasn't put it
to herself that way, but that's what she means. I'm
to do my best for him. She's left it to me with boundless
trust in my&mdash;my constructive imagination. Do
you see?"</p>

<p>I did. There was no doubt that he had hit it.</p>

<p>"This thing" (he brought his fist down on it), "when
I've finished with it, won't be Wrackham: it'll be all
me."</p>

<p>"That's to say you'll be identified with him?"</p>

<p>"Identified&mdash;crucified&mdash;scarified with him. You
don't suppose they'd spare me? I shall be every bit
as&mdash;as impossible as he is."</p>

<p>"You can see all that, and yet you're going through
with it?"</p>

<p>"I can see all that, and yet I'm going through with
it."</p>

<p>"And they say," I remarked gently, "that the days
of chivalry are dead."</p>

<p>"Oh, rot," he said. "It's simply that&mdash;she's worth
it."</p>

<p>Well, he was at it for weeks. He says he never
worked at anything as he worked at his Charles
Wrackham. I don't know what he made of him, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
wouldn't let me see. There was no need, he said, to
anticipate damnation.</p>

<p>In the meantime, while it pended, publishers, with
a dreadful eagerness, were approaching him from every
side. For Wrackham (what was left of him) was still
a valuable property, and Burton's name, known as it
was, had sent him up considerably, so that you can
see what they might have done with him. There had
been a lot of correspondence, owing to the incredible
competition, for, as this was the last of him, there was
nothing to be said against the open market; still, it
was considered that his own publishers, if they "rose"
properly, should have the first claim. The sum, if
you'll believe me, of five thousand had been mentioned.
It was indecently large, but Burton said he meant to
screw them up to it. He didn't mind how high he
screwed them; <i>he</i> wasn't going to touch a penny of it.
That was his attitude. You see the poor fellow couldn't
get it out of his head that he was doing something
unclean.</p>

<p>It was in a fair way of being made public; but as yet,
beyond an obscure paragraph in the <i>Publishers' Circular</i>,
nothing had appeared about it in print. It remained
an open secret.</p>

<p>Then Furnival got hold of it.</p>

<p>Whether it was simply his diabolic humor, or
whether he had a subtler and profounder motive (he
says himself he was entirely serious; he meant to make
Burton drop it); anyhow, he put a paragraph in his
paper, in several papers, announcing that Grevill Burton
was engaged simultaneously on the "Life and Letters
of Ford Lankester" and the "Personal Reminiscences"
of Mr. Wrackham.</p>

<p>Furnival did nothing more than that. He left the
juxtaposition to speak for itself, and his paragraph
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
was to all appearances most innocent and decorous.
But it revived the old irresistible comedy of Charles
Wrackham; it let loose the young demons of the press.
They were funnier about him than ever (as funny,
that is, as decency allowed), having held themselves
in so long over the obituary notices.</p>

<p>And Furnival (there I think his fine motive <i>was</i>
apparent) took care to bring their ribald remarks under
Burton's notice. Furny's idea evidently was to point
out to Burton that his position was untenable, that it
was not fitting that the same man should deal with
Mr. Wrackham and with Ford Lankester. He <i>had</i> to
keep himself clean for him. If he didn't see it he
must be made to see.</p>

<p>He did see it. It didn't need Furnival to make
him. He came to me one evening and told me that it
was impossible. He had given it up.</p>

<p>"Thank God," I said.</p>

<p>He smiled grimly. "God doesn't come into it," he
said. "It's Lankester I've given up."</p>

<p>"You haven't!" I said.</p>

<p>He said he had.</p>

<p>He was very cool and calm about it, but I saw in
his face the marks of secret agitation. He had given
Lankester up, but not without a struggle. I didn't
suppose he was wriggling out of the other thing, he
said. He couldn't touch Lankester after Wrackham.
It was impossible for the same man to do them both.
It wouldn't be fair to Lankester or his widow. He had
made himself unclean.</p>

<p>I assured him that he hadn't, that his motive purged
him utterly, that the only people who really mattered
were all in the secret; they knew that it was Antigone
who had let him in for Wrackham; they wouldn't take
him and his Wrackham seriously; and he might be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
sure that Ford Lankester would absolve him. It was
high comedy after Lankester's own heart, and so on.
But nothing I said could move him. He stuck to it
that the people in the secret, the people I said mattered,
didn't matter in the least, that his duty was to
the big outside public for whom Lives were written,
who knew no secrets and allowed for no motives; and
when I urged on him, as a final consideration, that
he'd be all right with <i>them</i>, <i>they</i> wouldn't understand
the difference between Charles Wrackham and Ford
Lankester, he cried out that that was what he meant.
It was his business to make them understand. And
how could they if he identified himself with Wrackham?
It was almost as if he identified Lankester&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Then I said that, if that was the way he looked at it,
his duty was clear. He must give Wrackham up.</p>

<p>"Give up Antigone, you mean," he said.</p>

<p>He couldn't.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Of course it was not to be thought of that he should
give up his Lankester, and the first thing to be done
was to muzzle Furnival's young men. I went to Furny
the next day and told him plainly that his joke had
gone too far, that he knew what Burton was and that
it wasn't a bit of good trying to force his hand.</p>

<p>And then that evening I went on to Antigone.</p>

<p>She said I was just in time; and when I asked her
"for what?" she said&mdash;to give them my advice about
her father's "Memoirs."</p>

<p>I told her that was precisely what I'd come for; and
she asked if Grevill had sent me.</p>

<p>I said no, he hadn't. I'd come for myself.</p>

<p>"Because," she said, "he's sent them back."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>I stared at her. For one moment I thought that he
had done the only sane thing he could do, that he had
made my horrible task unnecessary.</p>

<p>She explained. "He wants Mamma and me to go
over them again and see if there aren't some things
we'd better leave out."</p>

<p>"Oh," I said, "is that all?"</p>

<p>I must have struck her as looking rather queer, for
she said, "All? Why, whatever did you think it was?"</p>

<p>With a desperate courage I dashed into it there
where I saw my opening.</p>

<p>"I thought he'd given it up."</p>

<p>"Given it up?"</p>

<p>Her dismay showed me what I had yet to go
through. But I staved it off a bit. I tried half-measures.</p>

<p>"Well, yes," I said, "you see, he's frightfully driven
with his Lankester book."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;we said&mdash;we wouldn't have him driven for
the world. Papa can wait. He <i>has</i> waited."</p>

<p>I ignored it and the tragic implication.</p>

<p>"You see," I said, "Lankester's book's awfully important.
It means no end to him. If he makes the
fine thing of it we think he will, it'll place him. What's
more, it'll place Lankester. He's still&mdash;as far as the
big outside public is concerned&mdash;waiting to be placed."</p>

<p>"He mustn't wait," she said. "It's all right. Grevill
knows. We told him he was to do Lankester first."</p>

<p>I groaned. "It doesn't matter," I said, "which he
does first."</p>

<p>"You mean he'll be driven anyway?"</p>

<p>It was so far from what I meant that I could only
stare at her and at her frightful failure to perceive.</p>

<p>I went at it again, as I thought, with a directness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
that left nothing to her intelligence. I told her what
I meant was that he couldn't do them both.</p>

<p>But she didn't see it. She just looked at me with
her terrible innocence.</p>

<p>"You mean it's too much for him?"</p>

<p>And I tried to begin again with no, it wasn't exactly
that&mdash;but she went on over me.</p>

<p>It wouldn't be too much for him if he didn't go at it
so hard. He was giving himself more to do than was
necessary. He'd marked so many things for omission;
and, of course, the more he left out of "Papa," the more
he had to put in of his own.</p>

<p>"And he needn't," she said. "There's such a lot of
Papa."</p>

<p>I knew. I scowled miserably at that. How was I
going to tell her it was the whole trouble, that there
was "such a lot of Papa"?</p>

<p>I said there was; but, on the other hand, he needed
such a lot of editing.</p>

<p>She said that was just what they had to think about.
<i>Did</i> he?</p>

<p>I remembered Burton's theory, and I put it to her
point-blank. Had she read all of him?</p>

<p>She flushed slightly. No, she said, not all. But
Mamma had.</p>

<p>"Then" (I skirmished), "you don't really know?"</p>

<p>She parried it with "Mamma knows."</p>

<p>And I thrust. "But," I said, "does your mother
really understand?"</p>

<p>I saw her wince.</p>

<p>"Do you mean," she said, "there are things&mdash;things
in it that had better be kept out?"</p>

<p>"No," I said, "there weren't any 'things' in it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There couldn't be," she said superbly. "Not things
we'd want to hide."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>I said there weren't. It wasn't "things" at all. I
shut my eyes and went at it head downward.</p>

<p>It was, somehow, the whole thing.</p>

<p>"The whole thing?" she said, and I saw that I had
hit her hard.</p>

<p>"The whole thing," I said.</p>

<p>She looked scared for a moment. Then she rallied.</p>

<p>"But it's the whole thing we want. He wanted it.
I know he did. He wanted to be represented completely
or not at all. As he stood. As he stood," she
reiterated.</p>

<p>She had given me the word I wanted. I could do it
gently now.</p>

<p>"That's it," I said. "These 'Memoirs' won't represent
him."</p>

<p>Subtlety, diabolic or divine, was given me. I went
at it like a man inspired.</p>

<p>"They won't do him justice. They'll do him harm."</p>

<p>"Harm?" She breathed it with an audible fright.</p>

<p>"Very great harm. They give a wrong impression,
an impression of&mdash;of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I left it to her. It sank in. She pondered it.</p>

<p>"You mean," she said at last, "the things he says
about himself?"</p>

<p>"Precisely. The things he says about himself. I
doubt if he really intended them all for publication."</p>

<p>"It's not the things he says about himself so much,"
she said. "We could leave some of them out. It's
what Grevill might have said about him."</p>

<p>That was awful; but it helped me; it showed me
where to plant the blow that would do for her, poor
lamb.</p>

<p>"My dear child," I said (I was very gentle, now
that I had come to it, to my butcher's work), "that's
what I want you to realize. He'll&mdash;he'll say what he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
can, of course; but he can't say very much. There&mdash;there
isn't really very much to say."</p>

<p>She took it in silence. She was too much hurt, I
thought, to see. I softened it and at the same time
made it luminous.</p>

<p>"I mean," I said, "for Grevill to say."</p>

<p>She saw.</p>

<p>"You mean," she said simply, "he isn't great
enough?"</p>

<p>I amended it. "For Grevill."</p>

<p>"Grevill," she repeated. I shall never forget how
she said it. It was as if her voice reached out and
touched him tenderly.</p>

<p>"Lankester is more in his line," I said. "It's a question
of temperament, of fitness."</p>

<p>She said she knew that.</p>

<p>"And," I said, "of proportion. If he says what you
want him to say about your father, what can he say
about Lankester?"</p>

<p>"But if he does Lankester first?"</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;if he says what you want him to say&mdash;he
undoes everything he has done for Lankester. And,"
I added, "<i>he's</i> done for."</p>

<p>She hadn't seen that aspect of it, for she said:
"Grevill is?"</p>

<p>I said he was, of course. I said we all felt that
strongly; Grevill felt it himself. It would finish him.</p>

<p>Dear Antigone, I saw her take it. She pressed the
sword into her heart. "If&mdash;if he did Papa? Is it&mdash;is
it as bad as all that?"</p>

<p>I said we were afraid it was&mdash;for Grevill.</p>

<p>"And is <i>he</i>," she said, "afraid?"</p>

<p>"Not for himself," I said, and she asked me: "For
whom, then?" And I said: "For Lankester." I told
her that was what I'd meant when I said just now that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
he couldn't do them both. And, as a matter of fact,
he wasn't going to do them both. He had given up
one of them.</p>

<p>"Which?" she asked; and I said she might guess
which.</p>

<p>But she said nothing. She sat there with her eyes
fixed on me and her lips parted slightly. It struck me
that she was waiting for me, in her dreadful silence, as
if her life hung on what I should say.</p>

<p>"He has given up Lankester," I said.</p>

<p>I heard her breath go through her parted lips in a
long sigh, and she looked away from me.</p>

<p>"He cared," she said, "as much as that."</p>

<p>"He cared for <i>you</i> as much," I said. I was a little
doubtful as to what she meant. But I know now.</p>

<p>She asked me if I had come to tell her that.</p>

<p>I said I thought it was as well she should realize it.
But I'd come to ask her&mdash;if she cared for him&mdash;to let
him off. To&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>She stopped me with it as I fumbled.</p>

<p>"To give Papa up?"</p>

<p>I said, to give him up as far as Grevill was concerned.</p>

<p>She reminded me that it was to be Grevill or nobody.</p>

<p>Then, I said, it had much better be nobody. If she
didn't want to do her father harm.</p>

<p>She did not answer. She was looking steadily at the
fire burning in the grate. At last she spoke.</p>

<p>"Mamma," she said, "will never give him up."</p>

<p>I suggested that I had better speak to Mrs. Wrackham.</p>

<p>"No," she said. "Don't. She won't understand."
She rose. "I am not going to leave it to Mamma."</p>

<p>She went to the fire and stirred it to a furious flame.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>"Grevill will be here," she said, "in half an hour."</p>

<p>She walked across the room&mdash;I can see her going
now&mdash;holding her beautiful head high. She locked
the door (I was locked in with Antigone). She went
to a writing-table where the "Memoirs" lay spread
out in parts; she took them and gathered them into
a pile. I was standing by the hearth and she came
toward me; I can see her; she was splendid, carrying
them in her arms sacrificially. And she laid them on
the fire.</p>

<p>It took us half an hour to burn them. We did it
in a sort of sacred silence.</p>

<p>When it was all over and I saw her stand there,
staring at a bit of Wrackham's handwriting that had
resisted to the last the purifying flame, I tried to comfort
her.</p>

<p>"Angelette," I said, "don't be unhappy. That was
the kindest thing you could do&mdash;and the best thing,
believe me&mdash;to your father's memory."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid," she said, "I wasn't thinking&mdash;altogether&mdash;of
Papa."</p>

<p>I may add that her mother did <i>not</i> understand, and
that&mdash;when we at last unlocked the door&mdash;we had a
terrible scene. The dear lady has not yet forgiven
Antigone; she detests her son-in-law; and I'm afraid
she isn't very fond of me.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>Unspeakable, unlikable, worse than all, unsketchable.
A woman has no more formidable rival than
her idea in the head of an imaginative young man, and
Maurice Durant had been rash enough to fall in love
with Miss Tancred before sight.</p>

<p>He was rash in everything. When the Colonel asked
him down to Coton Manor for a fortnight, he accepted
the invitation (with much pleasure) by return, and
lay awake half the night with joyous anticipation. He
was in the train steaming into the Midlands before
he realized that he knew nothing of his host beyond a
vague family tradition. He was his (Durant's) godfather;
he was a retired Colonel of militia; he had
given him (Durant) a hideous silver cup; but this was
the first time he had given him an invitation. There
was something more, too. Durant had spent the last
seven years exploring every country but his own, and
he was out of touch with family tradition; but now
he thought of it he had&mdash;he certainly had&mdash;a distinct
recollection of hearing his father say that of all his
numerous acquaintance that fellow Tancred was quite
the most intolerable bore.</p>

<p>He had been a little precipitate. Still, he said to
himself, England was England, and if there was any
fishing on the Colonel's land, or a decent mount in
his stables, he thought he could pull through. Mrs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
Tancred was dead; he did not certainly know that
there was a Miss Tancred, but if there were he meant
to flirt with her, and if the worst came to the worst he
could always sketch her (the unsketchable!).</p>

<p>He had had plenty of time for anticipation during
the slow journey on the branch line from the junction.
The train crawled and burrowed into the wooded heart
of the Midlands, passed a village, a hamlet, a few
scattered houses, puffed and panted through endless
lengths of arable and pasture land, drew up exhausted
at the little wayside station of Whithorn-in-Arden,
and left him in that prosaic wilderness a prey to the
intolerable bore.</p>

<p>As ill-luck would have it, he had arrived at Coton
Manor three hours before dinner. At the first sight
of his host he had made up his mind that the Colonel
would have nothing to say that could possibly keep
him going for more than three minutes, yet the Colonel
had talked for two hours. Durant had been counting
the buttons on the Colonel's waistcoat and the
minutes on the drawing-room clock, and wondering
when it would be dinnertime. Once or twice he had
caught himself looking round the room for some sign
or token of Miss Tancred. He believed in her with a
blind, unquestioning belief, but beyond a work-basket,
a grand piano, and some atrocious water-colors, he
could discover no authentic traces of her presence. The
room kept its own dull counsel. It was one of those
curious provincial interiors that seem somehow to be
soulless and sexless in their unfathomable reserve. It
was more than comfortable, it was opulent, luxurious;
but the divine touch was wanting. It made Durant
wonder whether there really was a Miss Tancred, much
as you might doubt the existence of a God from the
lapses in his creation. Still, he believed in her because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
there was nothing else to believe in. He had
gathered from the Colonel's conversation that there
was no fishing on his land, and no animal in his stables
but the respectable and passionless pair that brought
him from the station.</p>

<p>Could it be that there was no Miss Tancred?</p>

<p>Durant, already veering toward scepticism, had been
about to plunge into the depths of bottomless negation
when the Colonel rose punctually at the stroke
of seven.</p>

<p>"My daughter," he had said, "my daughter will be
delighted to make your acquaintance."</p>

<p>And Durant had replied that he would be delighted
to make Miss Tancred's.</p>

<p>There was nothing else to be delighted about. He
had divined pretty clearly that Miss Tancred's society
would be the only entertainment offered to him during
his stay, and the most outrageous flirtation would be
justifiable in the circumstances; he had seen himself
driven to it in sheer desperation and self-defense; he
had longed hopelessly, inexpressibly, for the return of
the absconding deity; he had looked on Miss Tancred
as his hope, his angel, his deliverer. That she had not
been at home to receive him seemed a little odd, but
on second thoughts he had been glad of it. He would
have distrusted any advances on her part as arguing
a certain poverty of personal resource. Presumably
Miss Tancred could afford a little indifference, a touch
of divine disdain. And if indeed she had used absence
as an art to stimulate his devotion, she was to be
congratulated on her success. His dream had been
nourished on this ambrosial uncertainty.</p>

<p>Upstairs in his bedroom mere emotional belief in
Miss Tancred had risen to rational conviction. The
first aspect of the guest-chamber had inspired him with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
a joyous credulity. It wooed him with its large and
welcoming light, its four walls were golden white and
warm, and in all its details he had found unmistakable
evidences of design. There was an overruling coquetry
in the decorative effects, in the minute little arrangements
for his comfort. A finer hand than any housemaid's
must have heaped that blue china bowl with
roses, laid out that writing-table, and chosen the books
in the shelf beside the bed. A woman is known by
her books as by her acquaintance, and he had judged
of the mind of this maiden, turning over the pages
with a thrill of sensuous curiosity. This charming
Providence had fitted his mood to perfection with these
little classics of the hour, by authors too graceful and
urbane to bore a poor mortal with their immortality.
Adorable Miss Tancred! He was in love with her
before sight, at half-sight.</p>

<p>For at the sound of a punctual gong he had hurried
out on to the stairs, a door had opened on some unseen
landing, he had heard a woman's step on the flight
below; he had listened, he had watched, and as he
caught the turn of her head, the rustle and gleam of
her gown, some divine and cloudy color, silver or
lavender or airy blue, he had been radiantly certain
that his vision had passed before him. Down there
somewhere it was making itself incarnate in the unknown.
He felt already its reviving presence, the mysterious
aura of its womanhood.</p>

<p>Hitherto his imagination had been guided by a profound
sense of the justice that is in things. Destiny
who had brought him to this deceitful place owed
him compensation for the fraud, and an apology in
person was really no more than his due. What if Miss
Tancred were she, the supremely feminine, Destiny
herself?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>Under the echoing gallery the drawing-room had
opened and closed upon her, and he had followed, his
nerves tingling with the familiar prophetic thrill.</p>

<p>And this was Miss Tancred?</p>

<p>To begin with, he had never seen a woman more
execrably dressed. No doubt it is the first duty of a
woman's gown to clothe her, but apparently Miss Tancred's
gown had a Puritan conscience, an almost morbid
sense of its duty. It more than clothed her, it
covered her up as if she had been a guilty secret;
there was concealment and disguise in every crease of
the awful garment. In its imperishable prudery it
refused to define her by ever so innocent a curve; all
its folds were implicated in a conspiracy against her
sex. The effect, though striking, was obviously unstudied
and inevitable, and he argued charitably that
Miss Tancred was attired, not after her own mysterious
and perverse fancy, but according to some still
more mysterious and perverse doom. Happily she
seemed unconscious of her appearance, and this unconsciousness
had saved her.</p>

<p>For Miss Tancred was plain; and the irritating thing
about her plainness was that it, at any rate, was not
inevitable. She had had a hair's-breadth escape of being
handsome in a somewhat original and eccentric
way. And so her plainness was insistent; it would not
let you alone, but forced you to look at it, worrying
you with perpetual suggestions of the beauty it might
have been. Her black hair grew low on the center of
her forehead, whence it rose describing a semicircle
above each temple; she had a short and salient Roman
nose, black eyes, and straight black brows laid like an
accent on the jutting eyebones. Her mouth&mdash;there
might have been hope for her in her mouth, but for its
singular unreadiness to smile; there was no hope for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
her in her sallow skin, the dull droop of her eyelids, her
whole insupportable air of secrecy and reserve. A
woman has no business to look like that.</p>

<p>There could be no hope for any woman whom Maurice
Durant had pronounced unsketchable. He was
tolerant with the tolerance of a clever young modern
painter, trained to look for beauty (and find it, too)
in the most unlikely places. He could find no beauty
in Miss Tancred. She was useless for his purposes.
Those lips had never learned to flirt, to chatter, to sing,
to do anything spontaneous and natural and pleasing.</p>

<p>He shook hands with her in a paralytic manner, battering
his brains for a reply to her polite commonplaces.
Inwardly he was furious. He felt that he had
been duped, tricked, infamously cheated of his legitimate
desire; and he hated the woman as if she, poor
soul, had been personally responsible.</p>

<p>It had bored him to listen to the Colonel, and he was
sure it would bore him still more to talk to Miss Tancred;
but for ten minutes he did his best to sustain a
miraculous flow of sparkling monologue. If Miss Tancred
was going to bore him, at any rate it would not be
by her conversation. Some plain women he had known
who had overcome plainness by vivacity and charm.
Not so Miss Tancred. Being plainer than most she
was bound to make a more than ordinary effort, yet she
had adopted the ways of a consummately pretty woman
who knows that nothing further is required of her. Did
she think that he would go on forever battering his
brains to create conversation out of nothing, when she
clearly intimated that it was not worth her while to
help him? Never in his life had he met a woman who
inspired him with such invincible repugnance. He
found himself talking to her at random like a man in a
dream, and so indifferent to her opinion that he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
not in the least distressed at his own imbecility; and
Miss Tancred, like a lady in a dream, seemed to find
his attitude entirely natural; perhaps she had read a
similar antagonism in the faces of other men. (As it
happened, repugnance was an emotion that Durant
had frequently felt before, and certain emphatic lines
about his nose and mouth had apparently been drawn
there on purpose to express it.) Anyhow, Miss Tancred
made no attempt to engage his attention, but
turned her dull eyes to the Colonel, as if appealing to
him to take the burden of Durant's entertainment on
his own shoulders.</p>

<p>This the Colonel was perfectly prepared to do. It
was evidently an understood thing that Miss Tancred
should sit there, in that depressing attitude, while her
father monopolized their guest. Durant hastily classified
his host and hostess as the bore active and the
bore passive. If Miss Tancred had ever had any interest
or property in life she seemed to have made it over
to the Colonel, together with a considerable portion of
her youth. The Colonel wore his sixty years well out
of sight, like an undergarment; you even felt that there
might be something slightly indecorous in the suggestion
that he wore them at all. He was alive to the
finger-tips, alive in every feature of his aristocratic
little face. He seemed at first rather uncertain how
to take Durant, and looked him up and down as if in
search of a convenient button-hole; he smiled innocently
on the young man (Durant soon learned to know
and dread that smile); nothing could have been more
delicate and tentative than his approach. He had been
silent for the last few minutes, lying low behind a number
of the <i>Nineteenth Century</i>, for if he were a bore he
had the dangerous power of masking his deadly qualities
in an unreal absorption. At the signal that followed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
Durant's last desperate remark the Colonel's
tongue leaped as from an ambush.</p>

<p>His first conversational maneuver was a feint. He
inquired, with a certain affected indifference, what sort
of weather Durant had met with on the journey down,
and what sort he had left behind him in London; and
then he seemed inclined to let the weather drop. But
before Durant could get a word in edgeways he had
taken it up again and was handling it like a master.
Now he was playing with it, hovering round it lightly,
with a tantalizing approach and flight; now he had
gripped it tight, there was no more wandering from
the point than may be seen in the vacillations of a
well-behaved barometer; the slender topic seemed to
grow under his touch, to take on the proportions of his
own enormous egotism; he spoke of last autumn and
the next parish as if he were dealing with immensities
of time and space. And now the Colonel was merged
and lost in his theme; he was whirled along with the
stream of things, with moons and meteors, winds and
tides, never for an instant compromising his character
as a well-behaved barometer.</p>

<p>Never for an instant forgetting that he was a Tancred,
with a pedigree dating from the days of feudalism.
And after all he looked such a gentle little fellow that
Durant could almost have forgiven him. He was so
beautifully finished off. You could only say of him
that he was fastidious, he had the prejudices of his
class. He scorned to make conversation a sordid traffic
in ideas. At any rate, Durant felt himself released
from all obligation to contribute his share.</p>

<p>He had given it up, and was wondering how on earth
they were to get through the evening. Various dreadful
possibilities occurred to him; music (Miss Tancred
and Beethoven on the grand piano); family prayers;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
cards; in some places they sat up half the night playing
whist, a game that bored him to extinction. Thank
heaven, as there were but three of them, it would not
be whist. Meanwhile it was past eight and no dinner
bell.</p>

<p>As if in answer to his thoughts the Colonel turned
sharply to his daughter.</p>

<p>"Frida, are you sure that you wrote to Mrs. Fazakerly?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure."</p>

<p>"And are you equally certain that she is coming?"</p>

<p>"Quite certain. Unless she has been taken ill."</p>

<p>"What did you say? Taken ill? Taken ill?"</p>

<p>"I did not say she was taken ill, papa; I said nothing
but illness would keep her from coming."</p>

<p>"Ah, a very different thing." He turned to Durant,
blushing and bridling in his stiff collar as if the important
distinction had been a subtlety of his own.</p>

<p>He curled himself up in his chair, and Durant caught
him smiling to himself, a contemplative, almost voluptuous
smile; was it at the prospect of another victim?</p>

<p>Who the devil, he wondered, is Mrs. Fazakerly?</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Mrs. Fazakerly did not keep him wondering long.
Already she was tripping into the room with a gleeful
and inquisitive assurance. A small person, with a
round colorless face and snub features finished off with
a certain piquant ugliness. Her eyes seemed to be
screwed up by a habit of laughter, and the same cheerful
tendency probably accounted for the twisting of her
eyebrows. Mrs. Fazakerly must have been forty and
a widow. She was dressed with distinction in the half-mourning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
of a very black silk gown and a very white
neck and shoulders. She greeted Miss Tancred affectionately,
glanced at Durant with marked approval,
and swept the Colonel an exaggerated curtsey, playfully
implying that she had met him before that day.
It struck Durant that nature had meant Mrs. Fazakerly
to be vulgar, and that it spoke well for Mrs. Fazakerly
that so far she had frustrated the designs of
nature. He rather thought he was going to like Mrs.
Fazakerly; she looked as if she would not bore him.</p>

<p>If Mrs. Fazakerly was going to like Durant, as yet
her glance merely indicated that she liked the look of
him. Durant, as it happened, was almost as plain for
a man as Miss Tancred was for a woman; but he was
interesting, and he looked it; he was distinguished,
and he looked that, too; he was an artist, and he did
not look it at all; he cultivated no eccentricities of
manner, he indulged in no dreamy fantasies of dress.
Other people besides Mrs. Fazakerly had approved of
Maurice Durant.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the Colonel's instant monopoly of
the lady had the effect of throwing Durant and his
hostess on each other's mercy during dinner, a circumstance
that seemed greatly to entertain Mrs. Fazakerly.
Probably a deep acquaintance with Coton Manor made
her feel a delightful incongruity in Durant's appearance
there, since, as her gaze so frankly intimated, she
found him interesting. He was roused from a fit of
more than usual abstraction to find her little gray eyes
twinkling at him across the soup. Mrs. Fazakerly, for
purposes of humorous observation, used a <i>pince-nez</i>,
which invariably leaped from the bridge of her nose
in her subsequent excitement. It was leaping now.</p>

<p>"Mr. Durant, Miss Tancred is trying to say something
to you."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>He turned with a dim, belated courtesy as his hostess
repeated for the third time her innocent query, "I
hope you like your room?"</p>

<p>He murmured some assent, laying stress on his appreciation
of the flowers and the books.</p>

<p>"You must thank Mrs. Fazakerly for those; it was
she who put them there."</p>

<p>"Indeed? That was very pretty of Mrs. Fazakerly."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Fazakerly is always doing pretty things. I
can't say that I am."</p>

<p>In Miss Tancred's eyes there was none of the expectancy
that betrays the fisher of compliments. If she
had followed that gentle craft she must have abandoned
it long ago; no fish had ever risen to wriggling
worm, to phantom minnow or to May-fly, to Miss Tancred's
groveling or flirting or flight; no breath of flattery
could ever have bubbled in men's eyes&mdash;those icy
waters where she, poor lady, saw her own face. Durant
would have been highly amused if she had angled; as
it was, he was disgusted with her. It is the height of
bad taste for any woman to run herself down, and the
more sincere the depreciation the worse the offense,
as implying a certain disregard for your valuable opinion.
Apparently it had struck Mrs. Fazakerly in this
light, for she shook her head reproachfully at Miss
Tancred.</p>

<p>"If Mr. Durant had been staying with <i>me</i>, I should
have packed him into the bachelor's bedroom with his
Bible and his Shakespeare."</p>

<p>Miss Tancred, accused of graciousness, explained herself
away. "I put you on the south side because you've
just come from the Mediterranean; I thought you
would like the sun."</p>

<p>Why could he not say that it was pretty of Miss
Tancred?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>The Colonel had pricked up his ears at the illuminating
word.</p>

<p>"What sort of weather did you have when you were
in Italy?"</p>

<p>It was the first time that he had shown the faintest
interest in Durant's travels. He seemed to regard him
as a rather limited young man who had come to Coton
Manor to get his mind let out an inch or two.</p>

<p>Durant replied that as far as he could remember it
was fine when he arrived in Rome two years ago, and
it was fine when he left Florence the other day.</p>

<p>The Colonel shrugged his shoulders. "Ah, I don't
call that weather. I like a variable barometer. I cannot
stand monotony." As he spoke he looked at his
daughter. In a less perfect gentleman there would
have been significance in the look. As it was, it remained
unconscious.</p>

<p>"The Colonel," Mrs. Fazakerly explained, "is studying
the meteorology of Wickshire."</p>

<p>It seemed that Mrs. Fazakerly was studying the
Colonel, that it was her business to expound and defend
him. She had implied, if it were only by the motion
of an eyelid, that all they had heard hitherto was
by way of prologue; that the Colonel had not yet put
forth his full powers. Her effervescent remark was, as
it were, the breaking of the champagne bottle, the
signal that launched him.</p>

<p>Meteorology apart, the Colonel, like more than one
great philosopher, held that science was but another
name for ignorance.</p>

<p>"But with meteorology," he maintained, "you are
safe. You've got down to the bed-rock of fact, and it's
observation all along the line. I've got fifteen little
memorandum books packed with observations. Taken
by myself. It's the only way to keep clear of fads and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
theories. Look at the nonsense that's talked in other
departments, about microbes, for instance. Fiddlesticks!
A microbe's an abstraction, a fad. But take a
man like myself, take a man of even ordinary intelligence,
who has faced the facts, don't tell me that he
hasn't a better working knowledge of the subject than
a fellow who calls himself a bacteriologist, or some
other absurd name."</p>

<p>Durant remarked meekly that he didn't know, he
was sure. But the Colonel remained implacable; his
shirt-front dilated with his wrath; it was wonderful
how so gentle a voice as the Colonel's contrived to convey
so much passion. Meanwhile Miss Tancred sat
absorbed in her dinner and let the storm pass over her
head. Perhaps she was used to it.</p>

<p>"Fiddlesticks! If you don't know, you ought to
know; you should make it your business to know. If
I've got cholera I want to be told what'll cure me. I
don't care a hang whether I'm killed by a comma
bacillus or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A full-stop bacillus," suggested Mrs. Fazakerly.</p>

<p>"The full-stop bacillus for choice&mdash;put you sooner
out of your agony."</p>

<p>"For shame, Mr. Durant; you encourage him."</p>

<p>"I, Mrs. Fazakerly?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you. It was you who brought the <i>Nineteenth
Century</i> into the house, wasn't it? Depend upon it,
he's been reading something that he's disagreed with,
or that's disagreed with him."</p>

<p>Durant remembered. There were things about bacteriology
in that <i>Nineteenth Century</i>, and about hypnotism;
the Colonel had apparently seized on them as
on fuel for a perishing fire.</p>

<p>Heedless of the frivolous interruption, the little gentleman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
was working himself into a second intellectual
fury.</p>

<p>"Take hypnotism again&mdash;there's another abstraction
for you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here Mrs. Fazakerly threw up her hands. "My dear
Colonel, <i>de gr&acirc;ce!</i> If it's an abstraction, why get into
a passion about it? Life isn't long enough. You're
worrying your brain into fiddlesticks&mdash;fiddlestrings I
mean, of course. This child doesn't look after you.
You ought to have something tied over your head to
keep it down; it's like a Jack-in-the-box, a candle blazing
away at both ends, a sword wearing out its what's-his-name;
it's wearing out your friends, too. <i>We</i> can't
live at intellectual high pressure, if you can."</p>

<p>The Colonel softened visibly under the delicious
flattery of her appeal; he smiled at her and at Durant;
he came down from his heights and made a concession
to the popular taste. "Well, then, take influenza&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We'd very much rather not take it, if it's all the
same to you."</p>

<p>"Take what?"</p>

<p>"Why, the influenza&mdash;the bacilli, or whatever they
are. Or do the bacilli take <i>you</i>?"</p>

<p>"My dear lady, you don't know what you're talking
about. The bacilli theory is&mdash;is&mdash;is a silly theory."</p>

<p>And Durant actually smiled; for his own brain was
softening under the debilitating influence. He would
not be surprised at anything he might do himself; he
might even sink into that sickly state in which people
see puns in everything and everything in puns; it
would be the effect of the place.</p>

<p>"Well, it made you very ill last winter, that's all I
know."</p>

<p>The wrinkles stopped dancing over the Colonel's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
face; his shirt-front sank; he was touched with an infinite
tenderness and pity for himself.</p>

<p>"Yes. But I had a fit of the real thing. It left me
without a particle of muscle&mdash;legs mere thread-papers,
and no brain&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cherry-tart, Mr. Durant?"</p>

<p>The voice was Miss Tancred's. It was keen, incisive;
it cut the Colonel's sentence like a knife. But
if she had meant to kill it the unfilial attempt was
foiled.</p>

<p>"No brain at all, Durant." He held up a forefinger,
demonstrating on the empty air. "That, mind you,
is the test, the mark of true influenza&mdash;the <i>ut</i>-ter, abso<i>lute</i>
collapse of brain power."</p>

<p>"Im<i>bacilli</i>ty, in short."</p>

<p>Having emitted this feeble spark, Durant's intellect
went out altogether. Trusting to his face not to betray
him, he inquired gravely if it was long since the
Colonel's last attack of influenza.</p>

<p>But he had trusted rather too much to his face. A
painful flush spread over it when he found Miss Tancred
looking at him with a lucid, penetrating gaze. She
had recognized his guilt; it was impossible to tell
whether she had measured the provocation.</p>

<p>He, at any rate, had discovered the secret of her
silence; it was not stupidity, it was shame. The spectacle
of the Colonel's conversational debauches had
weaned her forever from the desire of speech. For the
rest of the meal he, too, sat silent, building a cairn of
cherry-stones at the side of his plate; an appropriate
memorial of a young man bored to death at a dinner-table.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>"Well now," said the Colonel, rousing himself from
a brief nirvana of digestion, "I hope that you will not
be dull." He said it with the confidence of a man who
has just laid before you a pretty convincing sample of
his social powers.</p>

<p>Durant started; he was alone with the Colonel and
the wine, and had just made the discovery that when
the Colonel's face was at rest he was very like an owl.</p>

<p>"To-morrow we'll go exploring together. I should
like to take you over my little property."</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the property was considerable;
but Durant noticed that its owner applied the endearing
diminutive to every object that appealed specially
to his egotism. It was a peculiarity of the Colonel
that he was ready to melt with affection over the
things that belonged to himself, and was roused almost
to ferocity by whatever interested other people.</p>

<p>"I dare say it will be good for you to see some fresh
faces and to be put&mdash;in touch&mdash;in touch with fresh
ideas."</p>

<p>You would have said that Durant had been sitting
for seven years with his feet on the fender while the
Colonel roamed the world.</p>

<p>Durant agreed. He was being hypnotized by the
hooked nose and the round hazel eyes with their radiating
wrinkles. He had been five hours in Coton
Manor, it felt like five years, and the evening had only
just begun.</p>

<p>His host stared at him, fidgeted nervously for five
minutes, plunged into nirvana again, emerged, and
with a shamefaced smile suggested that the ladies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
would be getting impatient. In the drawing-room his
nervousness increased; he went on like a person distracted
with an intolerable desire; he sat down and got
up again; he pirouetted; he played with ornaments;
he wandered uneasily about the room, opening and
shutting windows, setting pictures straight, and lighting
candles; he was a most uncomfortable little Colonel
of militia. And with every movement he revolved
nearer and nearer to a certain table. The table stood
in the background; Durant recognized it as the kind
that opens and discloses the magic circle, the green
land of whist. The table had a sweet and sinful fascination
for the Colonel.</p>

<p>Durant had just pulled himself together, and determined
that he could bear it if they didn't play some
infernal game, if they didn't play whist. And now it
seemed that whist was what they played, that whist of
course was what Mrs. Fazakerly was there for. The
Colonel looked from the table to the group, from the
group to the table; there was calculation in his eye,
an almost sensual anticipation. He seemed to be saying
to himself, "One, two, three, four; the perfect
number." Durant affected abstraction, and turning to
the window gazed out into the dim green landscape.
His host's eye followed him; it marked him down as
the fourth; it hovered round him, dubious, vacillating,
troubled. The Colonel had still some torturing remnants
of a conscience; he had read the deep repugnance
on the young man's face, and hesitated to sacrifice
a guest on his first night. He turned helplessly to
Mrs. Fazakerly, who put an end to his struggle.</p>

<p>She touched Durant lightly on the shoulder. "Come,"
she murmured gently, like a fate that pitied while she
compelled. "Come. He wants his little game."</p>

<p>It was as if she had said, "My poor dear sacrificial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
lamb, he wants his little holocaust. There is no help
for it. Let me show you the way to the altar."</p>

<p>"Frida!" It was the Colonel who spoke.</p>

<p>Miss Tancred spread open the table with the air of
a high priestess, hieratic and resigned. The Colonel
approached it, a lighted candle in each hand. For one
moment of time the egotist seemed to be rapt beyond
himself; he was serving the great god Whist. Cards
were the Colonel's passion; he loved them with delight
that was madness, madness that was delight. Cards
for cards' sake, the pure passion, the high, immaculate
abstraction; no gambling, mind you; no playing for
penny points; no pandering to a morbid appetite for
excitement. With cards in his hand the Colonel was
transformed. He might be wedded to matter of fact,
which is the grossest form of materialism; but at the
green table he appeared as a devotee of the transcendent,
the science of sciences, Whist.</p>

<p>Durant curled his long legs under the table and prepared
for a miserable evening, while the Colonel's face
beamed on him from between two candles.</p>

<p>"Durant," he said, "you are an acquisition. If it
wasn't for you we should have to play with a dummy."</p>

<p>Durant replied mournfully that he was not great at
the game, but he thought he was about as good as a
dummy.</p>

<p>"Don't you be too sure of that," said Mrs. Fazakerly.
"There's a great deal to be said for the dummy.
He isn't frivolous, he never revokes, he never loses his
little temper, and he plays the game."</p>

<p>"Yes, I think he can show you some very pretty
science, Durant." The Colonel's mustache and eyebrows
and all the wrinkles on his face were agitated,
but he made no sound. The owl was pluming all his
little feathers, was fluttering with mysterious mirth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
Oh! he took the lady's humor, he could enter into the
thing, he could keep the ball going.</p>

<p>"You see," Mrs. Fazakerly explained, "he has an
intelligence behind him."</p>

<p>"A dummy inspired by Colonel Tancred would be
terrible to encounter," said Durant.</p>

<p>Miss Tancred lifted her eyes from the cards she was
shuffling. Again he felt her gaze resting upon him for
a moment, the same comprehensive, disconcerting
gaze. This time it had something pathetic and appealing
in it, as if she implored him to take no further notice
of her father's fatuity.</p>

<p>"Confound the old fellow," he said to himself; "why
does he make me say these things?"</p>

<p>When they began Durant saw a faint hope of release
in his own stupidity, his obvious unfitness for the
game. By a studied carelessness, an artful exaggeration
of his deficiencies, he courted humiliation, ejection
in favor of the dummy. But, as it happened, either his
evil destiny had endowed him with her own detestable
skill, or else his stupidity was supreme. Trying with
might and main to lose, he kept on winning with horrible
persistency. He was on the winning side; he was
made one with the terrible Miss Tancred; and for the
first half hour he found a certain painful interest in
watching that impenetrable creature.</p>

<p>Miss Tancred played the game; she played, now with
the rhythm and precision of a calculating machine,
now with the blind impetus and swoop of some undeviating
natural force. It was not will, it was not intelligence;
it was something beyond and above them both,
infinitely more detached, more monotonous and cold;
something independent even of her desire. Durant
could see that she had as little love for the game as
he had. She played because she always had played, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
habit, a second nature that had ousted the first. Her
skill was so unerring that for Durant it robbed the
game of its last lingering attraction, the divine element
of chance. One tinge of consciousness, one touch of
fire, and it would have been sheer devilry. As it was
he could have been sorry for her, though in her infinite
apathy she seemed to be placed beyond his pity and
her own. With no movement save in her delicate sallow
fingers, she sat there like an incarnate Ennui, the
terrible genius of the house.</p>

<p>The Colonel, though losing rapidly, was in high good
humor. He displayed a chivalrous forbearance with
the weakness of Mrs. Fazakerly, who committed every
folly and indiscretion possible to a partner. He bowed
when he dealt to her; he bowed when she dealt to him;
he bowed when she revoked.</p>

<p>"'To err is human,'" said the Colonel.</p>

<p>"'To forgive, divine,'" said Mrs. Fazakerly, smiling
at Durant, as much as to say, "You observe his appropriation
of the supreme <i>r&ocirc;le</i>?"</p>

<p>And indeed the Colonel bore himself with some consciousness
of his metaphysical dignity. He was pleased
with everybody, pleased with Durant, pleased with
Mrs. Fazakerly, most particularly pleased with Colonel
Tancred, late of the Wickshire militia.</p>

<p>And as the game wore on Durant realized the full
horror of his position. The gallant Colonel was not
going to leave that table till he had won, and he could
never win. He frowned on Durant's proposal to change
partners; he would accept no easy victory. They were
in for a night of it. Durant was in torment, but he sat
on, fascinated by the abominable beauty of his own
play; he sat with every nerve on edge, listening to the
intolerable tick of time.</p>

<p>Ten o'clock. He thought it had been midnight. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
passed his hand over his face, as if to feel if it were
stiffening in its expression of agony.</p>

<p>And all the time Mrs. Fazakerly kept on raising and
dropping her eyeglass. Now and then she gave him a
look that plumbed the sources of his suffering. It
seemed to recommend her own courageous attitude, to
say, "My dear young man, we are being bored to death;
you know it, and I know it. But for Goodness' sake,
let us die with pleasant faces, since we can but die."</p>

<p>And Durant felt that she was right. He fell into her
mood, and passed from it into a sort of delirium.
There could be no end to it; his partner's pitiless hands
would never have done shuffling the cards. Black and
red, red and black, they danced before him; they assumed
extravagant attitudes; they became the symbols
of tremendous mysteries. His head seemed to grow
lighter; he was visited with fantastic impulses like the
caprices of an intoxicated person. To turn on the
Colonel and ask him what he meant by inflicting this
torture on an innocent man, whose only crime had
been to trust him too well; to shake the inscrutable
Miss Tancred by the hand and tell her that he knew
all&mdash;<i>all</i>, and that she had his sympathy; to fall on Mrs.
Fazakerly's neck and cry like a child, he felt that he
was capable of any or all of these things. As it was,
his behavior must have been sufficiently ridiculous,
since it amused Mrs. Fazakerly so much. The two
had reached that topsy-turvy height of anguish that is
only expressible by laughter. Theirs had a ring of
insanity in it; it sounded monstrous and immoral, like
the mirth of victims under the shadow of condign extinction.
As for his play, he knew it was the play of a
madman. And yet he still won; with Miss Tancred
for his partner it was impossible to lose. She sat there
unmoved by his wildest aberrations. Once, to be sure,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
she remarked with a shade of irritation in her voice
(by some queer freak of nature her voice was unusually
sweet), "Oh, <i>there</i>! We've got that trick again!"
Like him, she would have preferred to lose, just to
break the maddening monotony of it.</p>

<p>He pitied her. Once, in a lucid interval, he actually
heard himself paying her a compliment, much as he
would have paid a debt of honor. "Miss Tancred, how
magnificently you play!" She answering, "I ought to.
I've been doing nothing else since I was ten years
old." It was simply horrible. The woman was thirty
if she was a day.</p>

<p>Half past eleven. Midnight gathering in the garden
outside. The room was reflected on the window-pane
from the solid darkness behind it&mdash;the candles, the
green table, the players&mdash;a fantastic, illusive scene,
shimmering on the ground of night as on some sinister
reality. Mrs. Fazakerly was dashing down her cards
at random, and even the Colonel shuffled uneasily in
his seat. At twelve he observed that none of them
"seemed very happy in whist"; he proposed loo, a game
in which, each person playing for his own hand, he
could not be compromised by the ruinous folly of his
partner.</p>

<p>At loo Miss Tancred, also untrammeled, rose to
dizzying heights of play. She hovered over the green
table, motionless like an eagle victory. Then she
swooped, invincible. One against three she laid about
her, slashed, confounded, and defeated the enemy with
terrific slaughter. As Durant stammered, idiotic in his
desperation, it was "a regular Water-loo."</p>

<p>The Colonel kept it going. He laughed, "Ha-ha!
What do you say to a whiskey-and-water-loo? My
head's as clear as daylight. I think I could stand another
little game if we had some whiskey and water."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>A movement of Mrs. Fazakerly's arm swept the pack
on to the floor. "Frida," she cried, "take your father
and put a mustard plaster on the back of his neck."</p>

<p>Miss Tancred rose. She just raised the black accent
of her eyebrows as she surveyed the disenchanted
table, the awful disorder of the cards. She looked at
Durant and Mrs. Fazakerly with a passionless, interrogatory
stare. Then suddenly she seemed to catch
the infection of their dreadful mirth. It wrung from
her a deeper note. She too laughed, and her laughter
was the very voice of Ennui, a cry of bitterness, of unfathomable
pain. It rang harsh upon her silence and
was not nice to hear.</p>

<p>This unlooked-for outburst had the happy effect of
bringing the evening to an end. It seemed to be part
of the program that the Colonel should go home with
Mrs. Fazakerly to take care of her, and that Miss Tancred
should go with them both to take care of the
Colonel. They had not far to walk; only through the
park and across the road to a little house opposite the
lodge gates.</p>

<p>While they were looking for their hats Durant was
left for a moment alone with Mrs. Fazakerly. She
sank into a seat beside him, unstrung, exhausted; she
seemed to be verging on that state of nervous collapse
which disposes to untimely confidence.</p>

<p>"I like whist," said Mrs. Fazakerly; "but it must be
an awful game to play if you don't like it."</p>

<p>He followed her gaze. It was fixed on Miss Tancred's
retreating figure.</p>

<p>"Why on earth does she play if she doesn't like it?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Fazakerly turned on him, suddenly serious.</p>

<p>"She plays because the Colonel likes it&mdash;because she
is the best girl in the world, Mr. Durant."</p>

<p>He stood reproved.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Three days passed; they brought nothing new; each
was a repetition of the other; each merged itself in
whist. No relief came from the outside world; the
outside world must have found out long ago that it
was not worth while driving many miles to call on the
Tancreds.</p>

<p>Three days at Coton Manor would have been trying
to anyone; to Durant they were intolerable. For
limbs that had roamed the world to be tucked up under
the Colonel's whist table, for a mind equally vigorous
and vagrant to be tied to the apron-strings of the Colonel's
intellect, was really a refinement of torture.
Thrice Durant had tried to find an exit into the surrounding
landscape, and thrice the Colonel had been
too quick for him. He hovered perpetually round him;
he watched his goings-out and his comings-in; there
was no escaping his devilish ingenuity. While Durant
was looking for a stick or a hat, he would secure him
softly by the arm and lead him out for a stroll. He
would say, "My dear Durant, the women are all very
well in their way, but it is a luxury to have another
man to talk to." He talked to Durant, leaning toward
him lover-like, with the awful passion of the bore for
his victim.</p>

<p>These strolls extended over several miles, without
taking them beyond the bounds of Coton Manor.
Durant began to disbelieve in the existence of a world
beyond. Coton Manor had swallowed up the county;
it seemed to have opened its gates and swallowed him
up, too.</p>

<p>He told himself that he had done nothing to deserve
his doom. He was not more selfish or more exacting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
than other men; he was not sensual; he had not made
mere physical pleasure his being's end and aim. He
had been content with a somewhat negative ideal, the
mere avoidance of boredom. He never struggled or
argued with it, but whenever and wherever he met it
he had simply packed his portmanteau and gone away.
This repugnance of his had entailed endless traveling,
but Durant was a born traveler. Hitherto his life had
been free from any care beyond the trouble of avoiding
trouble. But he had been lax in this matter of Coton
Manor; he had had reason enough to suppose that
the visit would bring him face to face with the thing
he feared, and he had rushed into the adventure with
open arms. And now, this horror that he had eluded so
successfully for seven years he was to know more intimately
than his own soul; he was to sound all the
depths beyond depths of boredom. He had stayed in
dull places before, but their dulness struck him now
as na&iuml;f and entertaining by comparison. Other people
lapsed helplessly into dulness; at Coton Manor they
cultivated it; they kept it up. What was worse, they
took it for granted in other people. It never seemed
to occur to Miss Tancred or the Colonel that Maurice
Durant could be interesting, that he had done anything
worth mentioning. Not that he was sensitive to
their opinion, it was simply that this attitude of theirs
appealed unpleasantly to his imagination, giving it a
cold foretaste of extinction. It was as if his flaming
intellectual youth, with all its achievements, had been
dropped into the dark, where such things are forgotten.
At Coton Manor his claim to distinction rested on the
fact that he was the Colonel's godson. The Colonel
had appropriated, absorbed him, swallowed him up.</p>

<p>The fact that Durant was lapped in material comfort
only intensified his spiritual pangs. The Tancreds were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
rich, and their wealth was not of to-day or yesterday;
they had the dim golden tone, the deep opulence of
centuries. And they were generous, they gave him of
their best; so that, besides being bored, he had the additional
discomfort of feeling himself a bit of a brute.
As he lay awake night after night in his luxurious bed
he wondered how he ever got there, what on earth had
induced him to accept their invitation. He cursed his
infernal rashness, his ungovernable optimism; he had
spent half his life in jumping at conclusions and at
things, and the other half in jumping away from them,
however difficult the backward leap. He had jumped
at the Colonel's invitation.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, he would have jumped at anybody's
at the time.</p>

<p>When he came back from his travels he had found
himself a stranger in his own country. In every place
he touched he had left new friends most agreeably
disconsolate at his departure; he supposed (rashly
again) that the old ones would be overjoyed at his
return. As it happened, his reception in England was
not cold exactly, but temperate, like the climate, and
Durant had found both a little trying after the fervors
and ardors of the South. The poor fellow had spent
his first week at home in hansoms, rushing passionately
from one end of London to the other, looking up his
various acquaintances. He was disappointed, not to say
disgusted, with the result. (Maurice Durant was always
disgusted when other people failed to come up to
his expectations.) His best friends were out of town,
his second best were only too much in it. Many of
them had abjured art and taken to stiff collars and
conventions. He called on these at their offices. They
were all diabolically busy in the morning and insufferably
polite in the afternoon; they had flung him a nod
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
or a smile or a "Glad to see you back again, old fellow,"
and turned from him with a preoccupied air. He remembered
them as they were seven years ago, when
they were all Bohemians together. They had no manners,
good or bad, in those days, those young men; they
called you by strange names; they posed you in peculiar
attitudes and made abominable caricatures of
your noble profile; but they would lend or borrow a
five-pound note with equal readiness; they would give
you a supper and a shake-down at any time of the
night or morning. Now it seemed they thought twice
about asking you to dinner, if indeed they thought
about it at all. So Durant had been pleasantly surprised
at his godfather's genial letter. Why, bless his
little heart, the old boy had actually pressed him to
stay for a fortnight.</p>

<p>Well, how was he to get through that fortnight?
He decided that he would not get through it at all.
He kept himself awake devising schemes for his liberation;
he would find some business to take him up to
town to-morrow; or, if he could not find it, he would
invent it; he would send himself a telegram. And
then, against his will, his mind began running on Miss
Tancred. As he had been possessed by the ideal, so
now he was haunted by the reality; it had a horrible
fascination for him. He wondered if Miss Tancred had
ever been young; he wondered if Miss Tancred had
ever made a joke; he wondered if Miss Tancred had
ever been in love. This third idea was so incongruous,
so impossible, that at last he found himself dallying
with it for the mere extravagant humor of the thing.</p>

<p>If he had only been able to make himself agreeable
to Miss Tancred&mdash;for Miss Tancred, if she had the will,
had certainly the power to help him. The unhappy
young man had made a careful inspection of the stables
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
to see if there was a lingering chance for him there.
The sleek bays that brought him from the station&mdash;impossible;
the Colonel's cob, a creature too safe to
be exciting; and&mdash;yes, there was Miss Tancred's mare.
The sight of the fiery little beast dancing in her stall
had affected him with an uncontrollable desire to ride
her. The groom, not without sympathy, had interpreted
his longing glances.</p>

<p>"There's a-many casts sheep's eyes at that there
mare, sir; but it 'ud be as much as my place is worth,
sir, to let you or any other gentleman get atop of her.
Nobody lays a 'and on that annymal but Miss Tancred.
Miss Tancred's orders, sir."</p>

<p>He might have known it. Miss Tancred was good
for nothing, not even for the loan of a mount.</p>

<p>Miss Tancred seemed aware that nothing was expected
from her, and kept conscientiously out of his
way. He saw nothing of her from breakfast till dinnertime
and the evening, when she appeared as his official
partner in the game of whist. What became of her in
the meanwhile he did not know; he could only vaguely
conjecture. She seemed to vanish, to lose herself in
the vast workings of Coton Manor, or in that vaster
entity, the Colonel.</p>

<p>By the fourth day Durant's irritable mood had
changed to resignation. If he could not altogether
adopt Mrs. Fazakerly's attitude and smile pleasantly
into the jaws of dulness, he consented to be bored to
death with a certain melancholy grace.</p>

<p>He had made a dash for freedom; he had actually
started first thing in the morning with his sketching
block and easel, and was congratulating himself on
his benignant chance, when, as he sneaked round a
corner of the house, the Colonel stepped out upon him
from a side window. There was one hope for him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
Rain had fallen over night, and the little gentleman
was as yet in his slippers; he was feeling the damp
gravel like a fastidious cat.</p>

<p>"Ah-ha!" said he, in the tone of joyful encounter.
"And what do you propose to do with yourself this
morning?"</p>

<p>Durant looked at his host with a sad reproachful
gaze from which all bitterness had departed. He had
felt inclined to reply that he proposed to commit suicide;
as it was, he only said he thought of trying to
sketch something.</p>

<p>The Colonel seemed a little offended at the proposal;
it certainly implied that Durant had more confidence
in his own resources than in those of the house.</p>

<p>"So that's your fad, is it? I think we can do better
for you than that."</p>

<p>And as Durant had calculated he skipped back into
the house, and before he could return with his boots on,
Durant, by another miracle of chance or his own cunning,
had contrived his escape.</p>

<p>He made his way up a slight slope, whence he could
see far over the landscape. What he had as yet seen
was not inspiring, the heavy full-blown charm of the
Midlands in July, lonely, without any of the poetry of
loneliness. As he looked about him he realized again
that he was in the heart of the country, the great, slow,
passionless heart whose pulses are interminable hours.
If you love Nature as Durant loved her, for her sex
with its divine caprices, its madness and its mystery,
you will be disappointed with Wickshire. In Wickshire
Mother Nature is no dubious Aphrodite; she is
indissolubly married to man, and behaves like an ordinary
British matron, comely and correct. Durant saw
in the immediate foreground a paddock dotted with
young firs, each in a ring fence, beyond the paddock a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
field of buttercups shining with a polished gleam, beyond
the buttercups a horizon of trees. Before him to
the southeast, soaring above the roofs of Whithorn-in-Arden,
a church spire pointed the way to heaven; beyond
that, traveling low above the railway cutting, a
thin line of smoke indicated the way into the world.
Behind him were more trees; the green crescent of the
woods with the white front of Coton Manor shining in
their arms like a heavy, foolish face. He had no patience
with the landscape, with this Nature trimmed
and tamed, these shaven meadows and clean-cut hedges
and little rectangular plantations. It was a typical
English landscape, a landscape most unnecessarily
draped, where the bosom of the hills was always covered,
and the very elms were muffled to their feet. A
landscape destitute of passion and sensual charm, a
landscape like Miss Tancred.</p>

<p>Miss Tancred. He no longer felt any wild resentment
against that poor girl; he had learned to judge
her leniently. If you live with bores you inevitably
become a bore; at the same time, he admitted that she
was doing her best not to bore him. Meanwhile he
transferred his hatred to her surroundings.</p>

<p>This young man had no philosophy beyond the general
impression that the universe was under infinite
obligations to be good to him, a belief that had found
itself rather rudely shaken. He chose his view and
pitched his easel and relieved himself by one deep,
metaphysical, soul-satisfying curse at the devilry of
things. Then he set to work, and with the instinct of
a born painter he tried to find possibilities in the despised
landscape. Before long he had discovered mystery
in the woods that lifted their heavy rounded
contours to the sky, gathered and massed and piled
on one another like clouds; deep mystery in their green,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
green drenched with liquid and aerial gray, pierced by
thick black veins and hollowed into caverns of darkness
and blue dusk. And, though he knew that he was
tying himself to the place by taking it seriously, in an
hour's time he was absorbed and happy.</p>

<p>He was startled by a voice behind him. "Do you
think that it's so very beautiful?"</p>

<p>He turned round. Miss Tancred stood looking over
his shoulders, not at him nor at his sketch, but at the
distant prospect.</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;nice and open," he answered absently.</p>

<p>"Open? Wait till you've lived in it. To me it's like
living with all the doors shut."</p>

<p>"Too many woods, perhaps. And yet there's always
a charm about a wooded country; it's English."</p>

<p>"Yes, and, like everything English, it's much too
serious, too conventional, too"&mdash;she paused for her
epithet&mdash;"too disgustingly rich."</p>

<p>He was more startled than ever; she had put his own
feeling about it into words.</p>

<p>"And then it's so painfully proper and respectable.
Look at those ridiculous trees in their petticoats. English
to a degree."</p>

<p>"Ah!&mdash;if you've been abroad&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I haven't been abroad."</p>

<p>"Proud insular boast!"</p>

<p>"I wasn't boasting. I was stating a fact."</p>

<p>"Well, you've some cause to boast. Not to have
been abroad is distinction nowadays."</p>

<p>"If it comes to that I've never been out of this
county, except to London now and then. You wouldn't
think it."</p>

<p>He smiled, for it happened to be precisely what he
had thought. It explained her somehow; he recognized
in Miss Tancred the incurable provincial. To be sure,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
her sentiments were somewhat at variance with her
character, an inconsistency not unusual in woman.
All he said was, "It is a little extraordinary." He was
wondering when she was going to go. She did not go.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you've discovered something to do here.
It must be so deadly dull."</p>

<p>He found relief in ambiguity. "I am never dull";
adding irrelevantly, "it's a glorious view."</p>

<p>She brightened visibly. "If you like I can show you
a better one than this. It's not so very far;"&mdash;she hesitated&mdash;"we
might go to-morrow, perhaps; though it
wouldn't be very amusing, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>Again he felt a touch of compunction. She had so
clearly grasped the situation; she was so evidently
sorry for him, so conscientious, even if mistaken, in
her efforts to make amends, that he found her positively
pathetic. He answered humbly that he would
be delighted if she would be so good.</p>

<p>Then, conscientiously again, she left him. He
watched her tall figure departing with energetic strides,
and he decided that Miss Tancred was not so bad out
of doors, but that she needed a large background.</p>

<p>The next morning he had the grace to remind her of
her promise. They started at a rapid pace. Durant
left the paraphernalia of his art behind him by way of
intimating delicately that the hour was hers. Miss
Tancred was evidently prepared for vigorous walking.
She was dressed suitably and inoffensively in brown
holland. She took him up a long, gradually rising hill
to where a group of firs stood on an isolated mound.</p>

<p>Here Miss Tancred paused, with tilted profile, sniffing
the ambient air. "This," she said, "is the highest
point in the county; there is always a fresh breeze here;
to-day you can smell the sea."</p>

<p>"Impossible; we must be right in the very center of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
England, about a hundred miles from the nearest
coast."</p>

<p>"You can hear it, then. Shut your eyes and listen."</p>

<p>He obeyed. The wind moved and the firs gave out
their voice. He opened his eyes and glanced at Miss
Tancred. She was leaning up against a fir; her eyes
looked straight past him into the distance; the wind
had loosened the hair about her forehead; her lips
were parted, her eyes shone; there was an eagerness in
her face he had not yet seen there. It was as if a dead
woman had been suddenly made alive before him. She
was gazing and listening.</p>

<p>"If you've never been out of Wickshire, where have
you heard the sea?"</p>

<p>She answered curtly, "I don't know where I've heard
it"; then added, as if by way of apology for her manner,
"Do you like it?"</p>

<p>"Immensely."</p>

<p>"Then you must come up whenever you want to.
You can always be alone here."</p>

<p>She spoke as if she were giving him the freedom of
her private sanctuary.</p>

<p>"Have you any sketches of those places you've been
to abroad?"</p>

<p>"Sketches? Any amount."</p>

<p>"Have you brought them with you?"</p>

<p>He blushed. He had brought many sketches in the
hope of showing them to a wealthy godfather and an
admiring god-sister.</p>

<p>"Some&mdash;a few."</p>

<p>"I wish you'd show them to me."</p>

<p>"I shall be delighted." He blushed again, this time
for pleasure. With the desire to bestow a little of it,
he asked rashly, "Do you sketch, Miss Tancred? I
saw some water-colors&mdash;&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>"They were my mother's. I do nothing."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see." (They were going home now.) "I was
wondering what on earth you found to do here."</p>

<p>"I? A great many things. Business chiefly. My
father is secretary to the Primrose League. I write all
his letters for him."</p>

<p>"That's one way of being secretary to the Primrose
League."</p>

<p>"The usual way, I think. Secretaries generally have
under-secretaries, haven't they? My father dictates."</p>

<p>Durant smiled. He could see him doing it. "What
else does Colonel Tancred do?"</p>

<p>"He does no end of things. All the business of the
estate; and he speaks, at meetings, everywhere. He
has lectured&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was pathetic, her eagerness to vindicate his intellect,
to record his achievements, to convince Durant
that she was proud of him, not to let him see.</p>

<p>For the rest of the way she was silent, the light died
out of her eyes with every turning, and by the time
they had reached Coton Manor Miss Tancred was
herself again.</p>

<p>At whist that evening nobody was pleased. The
Colonel looked sulky and offended, possibly at Durant's
disaffection; Durant was moodier than ever, and even
Mrs. Fazakerly seemed depressed. Miss Tancred remained
imperturbable and indifferent, she won every
trick without turning a hair, but when it was all over
she left the table abruptly. She was visibly distressed.
Mrs. Fazakerly gazed after her with an affectionate
stare. She turned to Durant.</p>

<p>"For goodness' sake," she whispered, "say something
nice to her."</p>

<p>For the life of him Durant could think of nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
nice to say, beyond congratulating her on her success
in the accursed game.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fazakerly chimed in, "With or without a partner
Miss Tancred wins!"</p>

<p>"I always win. So, I imagine, does Mr. Durant."</p>

<p>"And why should I always win?"</p>

<p>"You? You win because you care nothing about the
game."</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>If you had told Durant that the end of his first week
would find him sitting under the firs in lonely conversation
with Miss Tancred, he would have smiled at you
incredulously. Yet so it was. Her fear of him, if fear
it had been, and not indifference, was wearing away.
She seemed anxious to make friends with him if possible
in a less painfully conscientious manner, and he,
on his side, was beginning to tolerate her. In fact, he
went so far as to own that, if it had not been for that
ridiculous idea of his, he would have tolerated her from
the first. It was not her fault if he had been fool
enough to fall in love with her before sight or at half-sight.
She had disappointed him (hence his natural
disgust); but the thing had happened many times before
in his experience. After all, he had had no grounds
for his passionate belief in Miss Tancred beyond the
argument from defect, the vague feeling that Destiny
owed him amends for her intolerable shortcomings.
But Durant's mind was too sane and versatile to be
long concerned with passion yet unborn. He was not
one of those pitiable sentimentalists who imagine that
every petticoat, or at any rate every well-cut skirt,
conceals a probable ideal. Some women of his acquaintance
had defined, not to say denounced, him as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
a consummate and dangerous flirt, but these were not
the most discerning of their sex. Durant described
himself more correctly as a sympathetic, though dispassionate,
observer of womankind. In other words,
he was not a vulgar flirt; he flirted with understanding.</p>

<p>An understanding without flirtation was springing
up between him and Miss Tancred. In this God-forsaken
place they were comrades in boredom and isolation.
She had said nothing, but in some impalpable
yet intimate way he knew that she, too, was bored,
that the Colonel bored her. The knowledge lay between
them unnamed, untouched by either of them;
they passed it by, she in her shame and he in his
delicacy, with eyes averted from it and from each other.
It was as if the horror had crept out through some
invisible, intangible doorway of confession; unseen,
unapproached, it remained their secret and the source
of their mutual pity. Meanwhile she no longer avoided
him; on the contrary, she showed an unmistakable
liking for his society. She would come while he was
sketching and sit beside him for five minutes, fifteen
minutes, half an hour, remaining silent, or merely exchanging
a few frank words with him before she went
her way. In these matters she was gifted with an unerring
tact; without a hint on Durant's part she seemed
to know to a nicety how far her presence was agreeable
or otherwise.</p>

<p>This time he had gone up the hill after dinner, and
had found her sitting in the accustomed place. They
had been alone that evening, for the Colonel was dining
intimately with Mrs. Fazakerly. That lady, with
a refined friendliness that did her credit, had refrained
from including Miss Tancred and Durant in the invitation,
thereby insuring them one evening's immunity
from whist. Durant could make no better use of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
freedom than by spending it alone out of doors; it
seemed that Miss Tancred had done the same with
hers.</p>

<p>She was sitting there on the edge of the mound,
clasping her knees and gazing into the distance. He
apologized for his intrusion, and she waked from her
abstraction with a dreamy air, making a visible effort
to take him in and realize him. But, though she said
simply that she was glad he had come, the effect of his
coming was to plunge her into deeper abstraction.
They sat for some time without speaking. Miss Tancred
had a prodigious faculty for silence, and Durant
let her have her way, being indeed indifferent to Miss
Tancred's way.</p>

<p>At last she spoke.</p>

<p>"It's odd how some people take Nature," said she;
"for instance, Mrs. Fazakerly says she loves it because
it's so soothing. She might just as well say she liked
listening to an orchestra because it sends her to sleep.
She can't love it for its own sake."</p>

<p>"You'll think me horribly rude, but I doubt if any
woman can. That is the one thing a woman is incapable
of&mdash;a pure passion for Nature, a really disinterested
love of life. It's an essentially masculine
sentiment."</p>

<p>"I don't at all agree with you."</p>

<p>"Don't you? To begin with, it argues more vitality
than most women have got. They take to it as a substitute
for other things; and to be content with it would
mean that they had exhausted, outlived the other
things."</p>

<p>"What other things?"</p>

<p>She was studying every line of his young, repugnant
face, and Durant was a little embarrassed by her steady
gaze.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>"Other interests, other feelings&mdash;whatever it is that
women do care for most."</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about women."</p>

<p>Her remark might have borne various interpretations,
either that she knew nothing about herself, that
she despised her own sex too much to include herself
in it, or that she had tacitly adopted Durant's attitude,
which seemed to leave her altogether outside of the
discussion. He talked to her unconsciously, without
any desire to please, as if he assumed that she expected
as little from him as he from her. She never reminded
him that she was a woman. It would have been absurd
if she had insisted on it, and whatever she was Miss
Tancred was not absurd.</p>

<p>She went on calmly, "So I can't say what they care
for most; can you?"</p>

<p>"You know my opinion. I wanted yours."</p>

<p>"Mine isn't worth much. But I should say that in
these things no two women were alike. You talk as
if they were all made of the same stuff."</p>

<p>"So they are inside&mdash;in their souls, I mean."</p>

<p>"There's more unlikeness in their souls, I imagine,
than there ever is in their bodies; and you wouldn't
say an ugly woman was quite the same as a pretty one,
would you?"</p>

<p>"Yes; in the obvious sense that they are both women.
I admit that there may be an ugliness that cancels
sex, to say nothing of a beauty that transcends it; but
in either case the woman is unique."</p>

<p>"And if the woman, why not her soul?"</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;because&mdash;because there is a certain psychical
quality that is eternal and unchangeable; because
the soul is the seat of the cosmic difference we
call sex. In man or woman that is the one unalterable
fact&mdash;the last reality."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>He spoke coldly, brutally almost, as if he, like herself,
was blind to the pathos of her ignored and rejected
womanhood.</p>

<p>She seemed to be thinking that last point over.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "I'm glad you came. I believe you
can help me."</p>

<p>"I shall be delighted if I can."</p>

<p>"What do you think of Mrs. Fazakerly?"</p>

<p>Durant was a little taken aback by the suddenness
of the question.</p>

<p>"What should I think?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I hardly know."</p>

<p>She knitted her black brows till they almost touched,
and propped her chin with her hand, as if she were
oppressed with the weight of her own thoughts. It
struck him that her provincial mind entertained an
unreasonable suspicion of the consummate little widow,
a woman's jealousy of the superior creature compact
of sex; and a sense of justice made him inclined to
defend Mrs. Fazakerly. Besides, he liked Mrs. Fazakerly;
she, at any rate, was not a bore.</p>

<p>"She's a very amusing woman, and I should say she
was an uncommonly good sort, too."</p>

<p>To his surprise her face brightened. "Should you?
Should you say that she had a good heart?"</p>

<p>"Really, Miss Tancred, I can't see into Mrs. Fazakerly's
heart, but I wouldn't mind betting&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That she's good? And affectionate? And
straight?"</p>

<p>"Straight as a die."</p>

<p>"And honest?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord, yes." He wondered whatever primitive
meaning she attached to the word.</p>

<p>"Well, if you think that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mind you, my opinion may be utterly worthless."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, no. It's just the very sort of opinion I want."</p>

<p>"Why should it be?"</p>

<p>"Because it's the opinion of a man of the world.
Mrs. Fazakerly's a woman of the world, so I thought
you'd understand her. I don't."</p>

<p>"I've known her exactly a week, and you?"</p>

<p>"Two years. But then I don't observe character,
and you do. And yet I have an intuition."</p>

<p>"Then by all means trust your intuition."</p>

<p>"That's it&mdash;I daren't. The truth is, I'm afraid of
myself&mdash;my motives."</p>

<p>"Your motives are not yourself."</p>

<p>"Aren't they? If it wasn't for them I should be certain.
I see she's a dear little woman, and I know that
I like her."</p>

<p>"Then, for Heaven's sake, go on liking her; it's the
best thing you can do."</p>

<p>"Isn't it rather horrid to like a person just because
they may be of use to you?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least. You were pleased to say I might
be of use to you, and I'm sure I hope you like me."</p>

<p>"Yes, I like you; but I think I like you for yourself.
I'm afraid of liking Mrs. Fazakerly from the wrong
motive."</p>

<p>"You can't like her from the wrong motive. You
can't have a motive at all, if it comes to that. You
might have a motive for killing her, or for cultivating
her acquaintance, but not for liking her. You either
like a person or not, and there's an end of it."</p>

<p>"If your motives are not yourself, what are they?"</p>

<p>"Lord only knows. Forces, tendencies, that determine
your actions, which are the very smallest part of
you. What you call intuitions, your feelings&mdash;hate (I
should say you were a good hater), and love&mdash;&mdash;" (her
eyes, which had been fixed on his, dropped suddenly),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
"don't wait for motives. They're the only spontaneous
things about you, the only realities you know." (And
of these he had said just now that the last reality was
sex. It was his point of view, a point from which it
appeared that for him Miss Tancred had no existence.)
"Of course there may be some transcendental sense in
which they're not realities at all; but as far as we are
concerned they're not only real, but positively self-existent."</p>

<p>As he thus discoursed, Durant blinked critically at
the sky, while his pencil described an airy curve on the
infinite blue, symbolizing the grace, the fluency, and
the vastness of his thought.</p>

<p>"They, if you like, are you. It's very odd that you
don't seem to trust them more."</p>

<p>She had turned from him till her face was a thin
outline against the sky. She had a fine head, and carried
it well, too; and at the moment the twilight dealt
tenderly with her dress and face; it purified the tragic
pallor of her forehead and all but defined that vague,
haunting suggestion of a possible charm. Durant had
it a moment ago&mdash;there&mdash;then. Ah! now he had lost it.</p>

<p>"I daren't trust my feelings. I can't. There are too
many of them. They won't work the same way.
They're all fighting against each other."</p>

<p>"Then let them fight it out, and let the strongest
win."</p>

<p>"If I only knew which <i>was</i> the strongest."</p>

<p>"You'll know some day. In the long run, you see,
the strongest is bound to win."</p>

<p>"Not necessarily. There might be a number of little
ones that all together would be stronger still."</p>

<p>"Oh, kill off the little beggars one at a time&mdash;go for
them, throttle them, wring their necks, jump on them;
and if they wriggle, <i>stamp</i>!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>"You can't jump on your own shadow. You can't
stamp on them if they're <i>you</i>."</p>

<p>He groaned. Miss Tancred was getting too subtle;
it was like sitting in the desert and playing at metaphysics
with the Sphinx. He had had about enough of
it. He rose, stretching his long limbs, and the action
suggested the hideous tension of his intellect.</p>

<p>"You must let yourself go, Miss Tancred&mdash;let yourself
go!" And he laughed at his own vision of Miss
Tancred; Miss Tancred insurgent, Miss Tancred flamboyant,
Miss Tancred voluptuous, volatile, victorious!</p>

<p>And then a thought struck him.</p>

<p>He turned and saw Miss Tancred still sitting motionless,
nursing her knees; her pure inflexible profile glimmered
against the dusk.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Durant had an idea, or rather two ideas, one purely
comic, the other comic or tragic, according to the way
you took it. He first of all discovered that the Colonel
was laying siege to the heart of Mrs. Fazakerly, and
at the same time conducting his campaign with an admirable
discretion. There never was a little Colonel
of militia so anxious to avoid committing himself. Not
that the event could be considered doubtful for a moment.
Measuring all risks, it was in the highest degree
incredible that he would be called upon to suffer the
indignity of repulse.</p>

<p>There was nothing extraordinary in that. To be
sure, on the first face and blush of it, Durant had wondered
how on earth Mrs. Fazakerly could tolerate the
Colonel; but, when he came to think of it, there was no
reason why she should not go a great deal farther than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
that. The Colonel's dullness would not depress her, she
having such an eternal spring of gaiety in herself. She
might even find it "soothing," like the neighboring
landscape. And as she loved her laughter, it was not
improbable that she loved its cause. Then she had the
inestimable advantage of knowing the worst of him;
her intelligent little eyes had seen him as he was; she
could lay a soft finger on all his weak spots. There
was this to be said for the Colonel, that he was all on
the surface; there was nothing, positively nothing, behind
him. Besides, Mrs. Fazakerly was not exacting.
She had not lived forty years in the world without
knowing the world, and no doubt she knew it too well
to ask very much from it. Then the fact remained
that the Colonel was an immaculate gentleman, immaculately
dressed, and he was not the only item in the
program. Coton Manor would be thrown in, and there
were other agreeable accessories. Mrs. Fazakerly's
tastes were all of the expensive sort, and her ambition
aimed at something vaster than the mere adornment
of her own person. In her household she displayed a
talent, not to say a genius, for luxurious order. But a
little dinner at the cottage opposite the lodge gates had
convinced Durant that this elegance of hers was of a
fragile and perishable sort. The peculiar genius of
Mrs. Fazakerly clamored for material and for boundless
scope. It could not do itself justice under two
thousand a year at the very least. As things stood its
exuberance was hampered both as to actual space (her
drawing-room was only eighteen feet by twelve) and
as to the more glorious possibilities that depend on
income. At Coton Manor she would have a large field
and a free hand. Heaven only knew what Mrs. Fazakerly's
mind was made up of; but quite evidently it
was made up.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<p>So far so good; but there was less certainty as to the
Colonel's attitude. As yet nothing was to be seen, so
to speak, but his attitudes, which indeed were extremely
entertaining. The little gentleman was balancing
himself very deftly on the edge of matrimony,
and Durant watched with a fearful interest the rash
advance and circumspect retreat, the oscillating hair's-breadth
pause, the perilous swerve, and desperate contortion
of recovery.</p>

<p>Durant felt for him; he had so much to lose. Under
Miss Tancred the working of his household was already
brought to such exquisite perfection that any
change must be for the worse. He had found out what
became of Miss Tancred in her mysterious disappearances.
As far as he could see the business of the estate
was entirely superintended by the lady. He came
across her in earnest conversation with the gardener;
he met her striding across the fields with the farm-bailiff;
he had seen her once on her black mare inspecting
some buildings on the farthest limit of the
property, the obsequious builder taking notes of her
directions. She was obviously a capable woman, a
woman of affairs. He presumed that these matters,
with her household and secretarial work, filled up her
days; he knew too well that whist accounted for her
evenings. He did not know if there was any margin,
any dim intellectual region, out of time, out of space,
where Miss Tancred's soul was permitted to disport
itself in freedom; she seemed to exist merely in order
to supply certain deficiencies in the Colonel's nature.
Mrs. Fazakerly had once remarked that Frida was "her
father's right hand." It would have been truer to have
said that she was right hand and left hand, and legs
and brain to the student of meteorology. There had
evidently been some tacit division of labor, by which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
she did all the thinking and all the work while he did
the talking. Thus, to continue Durant's line of argument,
the Colonel's comfort was secured to him without
an effort on his part (otherwise it would not have
been comfort); and when all was said and done Mrs.
Fazakerly was a most indifferent player of whist.</p>

<p>Then there was the Colonel's age. Durant knew a
man who had taught himself the 'cello at fifty-five.
But the Colonel was not that sort of adventurous dilettante.
Neither was Mrs. Fazakerly exactly like a
violoncello, she was more like a piano; while Miss Tancred,
from the Colonel's point of view, was like a hurdy-gurdy.
Not a difficult instrument the hurdy-gurdy;
you have only to keep on turning a handle to make it
go. To be sure, you can get rather more out of a piano;
but pianos are passionate things, ungovernable and
slippery to the touch. The Colonel was fond of the
humbler instrument that gave him the sense of accomplishment
without the effort, the joys of the
<i>maestro</i> without his labor and his pain.</p>

<p>He was in a double dilemma. If he had to choose
between Miss Tancred and Mrs. Fazakerly his choice
would never be made. On the other hand, if he decided
for both, his comfort would be more insecure
than ever. There would be jealousy to a dead certainty;
in all mixed households that was where the
shoe pinched. To pursue that vulgar figure, the Colonel's
daughter was like a pair of old and easy shoes
made by a good maker, a maker on whom he could
rely; a wife would be like new boots ordered rashly
from an unknown firm. They would be his best pair,
no doubt, but your best pair is generally the tightest.
He had some trying years before him; and well, a man
does not put on new boots for a long uphill scramble.</p>

<p>So the Colonel's breast was torn with internecine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
warfare, desire battling with habit, and habit with
desire. No wonder if in that awful struggle the fate
of one insignificant individual counted for nothing.
Frida Tancred never had counted.</p>

<p>Durant admitted that his imagination was apt to
work in somewhat violent colors, and that there might
be a point of view from which the Colonel would tone
down into a very harmless and even pathetic figure;
for Mrs. Fazakerly he had no terrors. But there was
the girl. It was hard to say exactly what he had done
to her. Apparently he had taken her soul while it was
young and squeezable, and had crushed it till it fitted
into all his little habits; he had silenced her heart with
commonplaces, and dulled her intellect with his incomprehensible
fatuity. And through it all he had
been the most innocent little gentleman alive. Oh,
yes, he was pathetic enough in his way. He himself
was only an instrument in the hands of irrepressible
Nature who couples wild soul with tame, hot blood
with cold blood, genius with folly, and makes her sport
of their unhappy offspring. And Nature was playing
a glorious game with Frida Tancred now.</p>

<p>That was Durant's second idea; the thought that
had struck him so unpleasantly after his last interview
with her. To put it coarsely, he had a suspicion, a
fear, that Miss Tancred was beginning to fall in love
with him. He might have known that it would happen.
It was just the sort of damnable irony most likely to
pursue that unfortunate woman. There could be no
mistake about it; he knew it; he knew it by many
subtle and infallible signs. Somewhere he had heard
or read that no nice man ever knows these things.
That was all nonsense; or, if it had any meaning at all,
it could only mean that no nice man ever shows that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
he knows. The fact remained that if he had loved her
he would not have known.</p>

<p>For the disagreeable circumstance itself he called
Heaven to witness that he had not been to blame. He
had been ready to do his part, to fall down and worship
the unknown Miss Tancred, the Miss Tancred of his
vision. The hour had been ripe, the situation also, and
the mood; the woman alone had failed him. Heaven
knew he had done nothing to make her care for him.
True, he had given her a certain amount of his society;
since she found a pleasure in it he would have been a
brute to deny her that poor diversion, that miserable
consolation for the tedium of her existence. Perhaps
he had tried too much to be sympathetic; but who
again would not have tried? He had given her nothing
to go upon. What had he ever given her beyond some
infinitesimal portion of his valuable time, at the most
some luminous hour of insight, or perhaps a little
superfluous piece of good advice that was of no possible
use to himself? For these things she had given
herself&mdash;given herself away. How ludicrously pathetic
some women are! You do them some kindness on an
afternoon when you have nothing better to do and they
reward you with the devotion of eternity; for they have
no sense of proportion. The awkward thing is that it
lays you under an eternal obligation to do something
or other for them, you don't know exactly what; an
intolerable position for a nice man.</p>

<p>So Durant's first feelings were surprise, annoyance,
and a certain shame. Then he began to feel a little
flattered, being perfectly sure that Frida Tancred was
not the woman to give herself away to any ordinary
man. He was the first, the only one, the one in a
thousand, who had broken down her implacable reserve.
He ended by feeling positively proud of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
power to draw out the soul of a creature so reticent and
passionless and strange.</p>

<p>His time was not yet up, and the question was:
Ought he to go or stay? He would have found or invented
some pretext, and left long ago, but that in
him the love of pleasure brought with it an equal fear
of giving pain. It would give pain to the Colonel
(who, after all, had received him kindly) if he went
before his time. By the art of graceful evasion Durant
had escaped many such an old gentleman as the Colonel;
but when it came to doing the really disagreeable
and ungraceful thing it seemed that his courage failed
him.</p>

<p>There was no doubt in Miss Tancred's mind on the
delicate point. She was even capable of making a
sacrifice to keep him.</p>

<p>He met her one morning riding on her black mare.
Miss Tancred looked well on horseback; the habit, the
stiff collar, the hard hat, were positively becoming,
perhaps because they left no room for decorative caprice.
She drew up, and Durant ran his hand lovingly
over the warm shining neck and shoulders of the mare.
Miss Tancred's eyes followed the movements of his
hand, then they traveled up his tall figure and down
again.</p>

<p>"Your legs are rather long," said she, "and you're
heavier than I am; but you can ride her if you like."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think of it," said Durant, magnificently
mendacious. He had been very early enlightened as to
his chances with the mare; but the temptation to ride
her had never died in him.</p>

<p>"Unless you ride," she continued, "there is nothing
for you to do here. Then you'll be bored to death;
and then, I suppose, you'll go?"</p>

<p>"And bury myself? And then?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>"You won't be buried long. You'll rise again fast
enough, somewhere else."</p>

<p>"And what if I do go and do all these things?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't want you to go&mdash;and do them."</p>

<p>She moved on, and he walked beside her, his hand
on the mare's mane.</p>

<p>"I can't think why you've stopped so long. Every
morning since you came I've been expecting you to go.
I thought you'd say your father was dying, or that
your partner was ill, and you had urgent business in
town. It's what they all do. Do you know, we've
asked no end of people down, and they never stay
more than three days. They always get letters or telegrams,
or something. No, I'm wrong; one man stopped
a week. He sprained his ankle the first day, and left
before he was fit to travel."</p>

<p>(Durant laughed. She really amused him, this <i>ing&eacute;nue</i>
of thirty, with the face of a Sphinx and the conversation
of a child.)</p>

<p>"And they never come again. There's something
about the place they can <i>not</i> stand."</p>

<p>They were walking leisurely together in full sight of
Coton Manor. She gazed at it anxiously.</p>

<p>"Does it&mdash;does it look so very awful?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;architecturally speaking&mdash;no, of course it
doesn't."</p>

<p>"Ah, you're getting used to it. Do you know you'll
have been here a fortnight next Monday?"</p>

<p>About the corners of her mouth and eyes there
played a dawning humor.</p>

<p>"Come, that sounds as if you did want me to go."</p>

<p>"No it doesn't. How could it? If you don't believe
me, here's the proof&mdash;you can ride Polly every day if
you'll stop another week."</p>

<p>Another week! Most decidedly she had a sense of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
the monstrous humor of the thing. If she could see it
that way she was saved. He had not the heart to kill
that happy mood by a coarse refusal; it would have
been like grinding his heel on some delicate, struggling
thing just lifting its head into life.</p>

<p>Besides, she had really touched him. His legs, as
Miss Tancred had observed, were a little long, otherwise
Durant had the soul and the physique of a tamer of
horses. The sight of Polly filled him with desire that
was agony and rapture; he saw himself controlling the
splendid animal; he could feel her under him, bounding,
quivering, pulsating, he himself made one with
every movement of her nervous, passionate body. It
was too much. Beside that large, full-blooded pleasure,
his scruples showed colorless and light as air.</p>

<p>That happened on a Friday. He had only two clear
days more. He found himself seriously considering the
desirability of staying over Monday.</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>As ill-luck would have it Saturday was a wet day,
and Durant, instead of riding the mare, was wandering
aimlessly about the house. He had finished all the
books in his bedroom and was badly in want of more.
He knocked up against Frida Tancred in a dark passage,
apologized, and confided in her. As usual she was
sorry for him.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid we haven't many books; but you'll find
some of mine in here." She opened a door as she
spoke, and passed on.</p>

<p>Durant found himself in a room which he had not
yet investigated. It was somewhat bare as to furniture;
it struck strange to his senses as if he had stumbled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
into another world; in some occult way it preserved
a tradition of travel and adventure. The bookcase
he came to inspect was flanked by a small cabinet
of coins and curios&mdash;Italian, Grecian, Egyptian, and
Japanese; the walls were hung with bad landscapes interspersed
with maps.</p>

<p>One of these, an uncolored map of Europe, attracted
his attention. It was drawn by hand in Indian ink, a
red line and accompanying arrow heads followed the
coast and strung together such inland places as were
marked upon the blank. The line started from Southampton
and reached the Mediterranean by the Bay of
Biscay; it shot inland to the great cities of Italy, returning
always to the sea. It skirted Greece, wound
in and out of the Ionian islands, touched at Constantinople,
ringed the Bosporus and the Black Sea,
wheeled to Moscow and St. Petersburg, and then swept
wildly up the north of Russia to Archangel and the
Arctic Ocean; thence it followed the Scandinavian
coast-line, darted to Iceland, and dipped southward
again to Britain by way of the Hebrides. Off Queenstown
the arrowheads pointed west, winged for the
Atlantic. He found the same red line again on a blank
map of Asia heading for India by China and Japan.
An adventurous, erratic line, whose stages were now
the capitals of the world, and now some unknown
halting-place in the immeasurable waste. And what
on earth did it mean? Was it the record of an actual
journey, or some yet untraveled visionary route?</p>

<p>But it was not these things alone that gave the room
its fantastic and alien air. What dominated the place
was the portrait of a woman, a woman who had Frida's
queer accented eyebrows and Frida's eyes, with some
more fiery and penetrating quality of her own, something
more inimitably fine and foreign. The portrait
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
(which struck Durant as decidedly clever) was signed
by some unknown Russian artist, and he recognized it
as that of Frida's mother, the lady of the landscapes.
He wondered if it was the demon of <i>ennui</i> that had
driven poor Mrs. Tancred to the practice of her terrible
art, if she had had a spite against Coton Manor,
which she vented by covering its walls with bad pictures.</p>

<p>He turned to the bookcase. Frida's library offered
him an amazing choice of polyglot fiction. It contained
nearly all Balzac and the elder Dumas, Tolstoi and
Turgenieff, Bj&ouml;rnsen and Ibsen, besides a great deal
of miscellaneous literature, chiefly Russian and Norwegian.
Here and there he came across some odd volumes
of modern Greek. A whole shelf was devoted to
books of travel; grammars and dictionaries made up
the rest. Miss Tancred's taste in books was a little
outlandish, but it was singularly virile and robust.
He had been prepared to suspect her of a morbid
pedantry, having known more than one lady in her
desperate case who found consolation in the dead languages.
But Miss Tancred betrayed no ghoulish appetites;
if she had a weakness for tongues, she had
also the good taste to prefer them living.</p>

<p>Durant was so much absorbed in these observations
that he did not hear her come into the room.</p>

<p>"Have you found anything you can read?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"I've found a great deal that I can't read. You <i>do</i>
go in strong for languages."</p>

<p>"That's nothing; my mother was a Russian, and
Russians know every language better than their own.
I don't know more than seven besides mine. And I
can only read and write them. They will never be any
use to me."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>"How can you tell what may be of use to you? Even
Mrs. Fazakerly, or I?" Durant was anxious to give a
playful turn to that remarkable discussion they once
had; he thus hoped to set the tone for all future conversations
with Miss Tancred. "I admit that you can't
live on languages, they are not exactly safety-valves
for the emotions; nobody can swear in more than three
of them at a time. I think music's better. Instead
of playing whist you ought to play Chopin."</p>

<p>"It's better to play whist well than Chopin badly."</p>

<p>"Better to rule in Hades than fool in the other place,
you think? Miss Tancred, you are as proud as Lucifer."</p>

<p>"I don't see that any good is got by murdering the
masters."</p>

<p>"It saves some women from worse crimes, I believe.
Why didn't you take to sketching, then? <i>That</i> only
kills time."</p>

<p>Miss Tancred was splendid in her scorn. "Kill time
with painting bad pictures? I'd rather time killed me."</p>

<p>Ah, that was what he liked about her. She had not
revenged herself on Nature by making hideous caricatures
of Nature's face; she did not draw in milk-and-water
colors, and she did not strum. She had
none of the exasperating talents, the ludicrous ambitions
of the amateur; she was altogether innocent of
intellectual vanity.</p>

<p>"That reminds me," said she, "that I've seen nothing
of those wonderful sketches you said you'd show me."</p>

<p>He had clean forgotten the things. Well, he could
hardly do better than exhibit them; it would keep her
quiet, and save him from perilous personalities.</p>

<p>At first he thought the exhibition was going to give
her more pain than pleasure. He sat beside her, and
she took the sketches from him gingerly, one by one,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
and looked at them without a word. A visible nervousness
possessed her; her pulses clamored, she seemed to
struggle with her own unsteady breathing. Once, when
in the transfer of a drawing her hand brushed against
his, she drew it back again as if it had dashed against
a flame. Durant had noticed once or twice before that
she avoided his touch.</p>

<p>Suddenly she awoke out of the agony of her consciousness.
One picture had held her longer than the
rest.</p>

<p>"It's beautiful&mdash;beautiful," she murmured.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you like it," said Durant, pleased at her
first sign of admiration.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mean your picture&mdash;I mean the place."</p>

<p>"It's not a very good picture perhaps&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't know whether it's good or bad; it seems to
me rather bad, though I can't say what's wrong with
it. It looks unfinished."</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> unfinished, but that's not what's wrong with
it. These are better&mdash;better painting."</p>

<p>His hand brushed hers in vain this time. She remained
absorbed. "I don't care two straws about the
painting; they may be masterpieces for all I know; it's
<i>that</i>&mdash;that stretch of sand licked by the sea, and the
grass trodden down by the wind&mdash;the agony and beauty
and desolation of it&mdash;&mdash;" She laid it down unwillingly,
and took the others from his hand.</p>

<p>"Oh, what's this?"</p>

<p>"A wall in Suza."</p>

<p>"I've never seen anything like that. The light seems
to be moving&mdash;soaking into it and streaming out again.
It looks as if it would burn if you touched it."</p>

<p>The artist in him laughed for pure pleasure. "It's
all very well, you know, but they must be infernally
good if they make you feel like that."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p>"They may be. Have you seen all these things, or
have you done any of them out of your head?"</p>

<p>"Seen them, of course. I never paint 'out of my
head'; I haven't enough imagination."</p>

<p>"Show me more places where you've been. Tell me
about them. You might have done that before."</p>

<p>He obeyed, giving her his experience, his richest and
his best; he drew for her scenes and things, not in their
crude and temporary form, but as they lived for him
and for his art, idealized, eternalized by the imagination
that sees them as parts of the immortal whole;
and yet vivid, individual, drenched with the peculiar
color that made them equally and forever one with the
soul of Maurice Durant. She hardly seemed to heed,
hardly seemed to listen or to follow. She looked as
if hearing were already absorbed in sight.</p>

<p>Durant put a small oil painting into her hand. He
had kept his finest to the last. "If you're fond of the
sea that may please you."</p>

<p>Mid-ocean, the slope and trough of a luminous sea;
in the foreground one smooth, high-bosomed, unbroken
wave, the light flung off from its crest like foam, to
slide down its shoulder like oil on rounded glass. On
the sky-line the white peak of a sail; the whole a heaving
waste of wind and water, light and air. It was a
consummate bit of painting, as nobody knew better
than Maurice Durant.</p>

<p>She looked at it as though she would never be tired
of looking. A sudden impulse seized him, a blind
instinct to give pleasure at any cost, to make amends
for pain.</p>

<p>"If you honestly like it, I wish you'd keep it."</p>

<p>"Keep it? Keep it? Do you really mean it?"</p>

<p>"It would give me pleasure if you would."</p>

<p>"But isn't&mdash;might it not be valuable?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p>It was valuable, as Durant reflected somewhat regretfully,
but he answered well. "Valuable chiefly to me,
I fancy. Which is all the more reason, if you like
it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Like it? I should lo&mdash;&mdash;" She drew back her
breath. "No; I think I'd better not. Thank you very
much, all the same." She laid the canvas down with
a gesture of renunciation.</p>

<p>"Now that's foolish. Why ever won't you?"</p>

<p>"I daren't. I daren't live with it. It would remind
me of all the things I want to forget."</p>

<p>"What things?" He felt that the question was cruel,
it was probing the very heart of pain. But his curiosity
was too strong. The fountains of the deep were
breaking up; he knew that he had only to give the
word to witness an astounding transformation of the
woman. He had given the word. Her face was changing;
it had taken on the likeness of her foreign mother,
intensified in its subtlety and fire.</p>

<p>"What things? The things I want to do and can't;
the things I want to see&mdash;the things&mdash;&mdash;" She stopped.
"Do you know, I don't even like to have those sketches
of my mother's hanging about; they haunt me so intolerably,
they tempt me to that degree that sometimes
I can hardly bear to look at them."</p>

<p>He glanced at the drawings. <i>He</i> could hardly bear
to look at them either. Poor wraiths and skeletons of
landscapes, he would have thought them too fleshless
and bloodless to touch even the ghost of longing.</p>

<p>She took up the picture she had just laid down.
"But <i>this</i>&mdash;it's not painting, it's real; it's a piece torn
out of the living world. It would bring it so horribly
near me&mdash;don't you see?"</p>

<p>He thought he saw. He looked, and she lowered her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
eyelids. On to the slope of his wave there splashed a
tear, salt to the salt.</p>

<p>She got up, turned away from him, and leaned
against the window frame, staring out at the gravel
walk, the lawn, the paddock, all the sedate, intolerable
scene. Her breast heaved; she was shaken by a tumult
of vision and desire.</p>

<p>"If only I could get away&mdash;get away from this!"</p>

<p>It was not she that cried out, but some other self,
unacknowledged and unappeased, smothered and
crushed and hidden out of sight.</p>

<p>Durant was moved by the revelation, and a little
frightened, too.</p>

<p>"And why not get away?" he asked gently.</p>

<p>"Because I can't do anything like other people, by
bits and halves. If I once go, I shall never come back&mdash;never.
There's no use thinking about it. I've
thought about it till I could have gone mad." She
faced him bravely. "Mr. Durant, if you ever want a
thing as badly as I want that, let me tell you that it
will be simpler and easier to give it up altogether, for
always, than to keep on looking at it and touching it
and letting it go."</p>

<p>"Do you apply that principle to everything?"</p>

<p>"Nearly everything."</p>

<p>"H'm. Uncompromising. Yet I doubt if you are
wise."</p>

<p>"Wise? Isn't it wiser to stand a little hunger than
to go back to starvation after luxury?"</p>

<p>"Oh, of course; at that rate you can bring your soul
down to a straw a day. But in the end, you know, it
dies."</p>

<p>"If it comes to that, mine was dead ages ago, and
buried quite decently, too. I think we won't dig it up
again; by this time it might not look pretty."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<p>At any other time she would have alienated his
sympathy by that nasty speech; it was the sort of
thing he hated women to say. But he forgave her because
of her evident sincerity.</p>

<p>She dried her eyes and left him to his own reflections.</p>

<p>So this was Frida Tancred? And he had thought of
her as the Colonel's daughter, a poor creature, subdued
to the tyranny of habit. Habit indeed! She had never
known even that comparative calm. It was not habit
that had bound her to that dreadful old man, who was
the father of her body, but with whom her soul recognized
no kinship. Her life must have been an agony
of self-renunciation, an eternal effort not to be.</p>

<p>He doubted her wisdom; but he was not sure that he
did not admire her courage. That uncompromising
attitude was more dignified than the hesitations of
weaker natures. When women set out with the bold
intention of living resolutely in the Whole, the Good,
and the Beautiful, they sometimes find themselves
brought up sharply midway at the threshold of the
Good; and there they stand vacillating all the time, or
at the most content themselves now and then with a
terrified rush for the Beautiful and the Whole. They
are fascinated by all three and faithful to none. Frida
Tancred scorned their fatuous procedure. Balked of
the best, she would never console herself with half-measures
and the second best; as for all lesser values,
there was something in her which would always mark
her from Mrs. Fazakerly and her kind. With Frida it
was either the whole or nothing; either four bare walls
or the open road where there is no returning.</p>

<p>She would go no way where the Colonel could not

<p>Durant, on his way to bed that night, saw something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
that told him so much. Father and daughter
stood with their backs to him at the end of the long
corridor. The Colonel was putting out the lights.
Frida had just nodded good night to him at her bedroom
door, when she turned impetuously and flung her
arms round the little gentleman. She pressed his head
against her neck and held it there an instant, a passion
of remorse and tenderness in the belated caress. The
Colonel was, as it were, taken off his feet; he was visibly
embarrassed. Durant saw his eyes staring over
her shoulder, in their profound stupidity helpless and
uncomprehending.</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>It was Sunday afternoon, and they had been taking
tea with Mrs. Fazakerly. This was the second time
that Durant had had the opportunity of studying
Mrs. Fazakerly at home, of filling in the little figure
on its own appropriate background. The first thing
that struck him was that the background was not appropriate,
or rather that it was inadequate. Mrs.
Fazakerly's drawing-room had an air of uneasy elegance,
of appearances painfully supported on the thin
edge of two hundred a year. It was furnished with a
too conspicuous care; the most insignificant details
were arranged so as to lead up to and set off her good
things, which were few and far between. There was
no rest in it for the eye that was perpetually seized
and riveted on some bit of old silver, or Oriental drapery,
some Chippendale cabinet or chair. Such things
were the commonplaces of Coton Manor, and there
they fell unobtrusively into their place. Here they
were touched up and handled, posed out of all simplicity;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
they bore themselves accordingly with a shining
consciousness of their own rarity; they made an
unblushing bid for praise. In Mrs. Fazakerly's drawing-room
the note of taste was forced.</p>

<p>The invitation had come as a sort of farewell attention
to Durant. Its valedictory character was further
emphasized by Mrs. Fazakerly's proposing to walk
home with them, and finally falling into the rear with
Durant.</p>

<p>As a turn in the drive brought them within sight
of Coton Manor, Mrs. Fazakerly balanced her <i>pince-nez</i>
on the bridge of her nose. It remained there, and
he judged that Mrs. Fazakerly was in no mood for
mirth.</p>

<p>"That house," said Mrs. Fazakerly, "annoys me."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because it hasn't had justice done to it."</p>

<p>"I should have thought that was a ground for pity
rather than resentment."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fazakerly shrugged her shoulders ever so little.
"That drawing-room&mdash;did you ever see anything like
it? And such possibilities in it, too. I can't bear to
think of all those beautiful things wasted, just for want
of a little taste, a little arrangement&mdash;the right touch."</p>

<p>The widow's white fingers twitched. It was not
vulgar cupidity; it was the passion of the born genius,
of the lover of art for art's sake, who sees his opportunity
given into the hands of an inferior. If only
she had the ordering, the decoration of Coton Manor!
Durant thought of the cottage at the gates, her
cramped and humble sphere; it was not her fault so
much as the defect of her instrument, that forcing of
the note of taste; no wonder that she longed for the
rich harmonies of Coton Manor under "the right
touch," the touch of the master.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p>She continued, "But poor dear Miss Tancred, you
know, she will have it left just as it was in Mrs.
Tancred's time; she won't change a picture or a chair
in it. That's Frida all over. She's made that house
a monument to her mother's memory. And think
what she might have made it."</p>

<p>"I'm thinking what she might have made of her
life. She seems to be making that a monument to her
father's memory."</p>

<p>"Ah! and the things she could have done with it."</p>

<p>Impossible to say whether Mrs. Fazakerly referred
to Miss Tancred's house or her life. Durant smiled
at her probable conception of Coton Manor, with its
tragedy of splendid possibilities gone to waste; but
Mrs. Fazakerly's idea cut both ways.</p>

<p>She sighed wearily.</p>

<p>"These drives were not made to be walked up.
There's another mile and a half of it, and I'm half-dead
already. I shall sit down."</p>

<p>She led the way to an elm tree fallen in the grass,
examined it critically, sat down, and made a place for
him at her side.</p>

<p>"So you're going to-morrow? Is that so?"</p>

<p>"It is&mdash;probably."</p>

<p>"It's a pity&mdash;just as you and Miss Tancred have
made friends."</p>

<p>"The best of friends must part," said he lightly.</p>

<p>"Yes. Well, I'm glad you've managed to be nice
to her, after all. She's come out in the most astonishing
manner since you came. What have you been
doing to her?"</p>

<p>"I've done nothing to her, I assure you."</p>

<p>"Ah, you mean you've not been making love to her."</p>

<p>"I don't mean anything of the sort."</p>

<p>Durant was angry. It was borne in upon him that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
Mrs. Fazakerly was vulgar, after all. She looked at
him, and her <i>pince-nez</i> balanced itself on the bridge
of her nose, then leapt its suicidal leap. She was
amused with the ambiguity of his reply.</p>

<p>"<i>That's</i> all right. Heaven help the man who does
make love to her, if he means it. That girl's a riddle
to me. I used to think she cared a little for her father;
but it's my belief that Frida Tancred cares for nobody,
not even herself. She simply doesn't know what love
is, and she doesn't want to know. Why am I saying
these alarming things to you? I'm saying them because
I'm old enough to be your mother, and because
I like you. You're clever, and you've got a sense of
humor, too, though I can't say it's been much use
to you since you came here. But, with all your cleverness,
you'll never understand Frida Tancred. She's not
like other women, the sort you've flirted with so much.
Don't tell me you haven't; for you have. She can't
help it. Her mother was a queer fantastic creature,
and Frida's just like her, only stronger, much stronger,
and deeper, which makes it worse. I'm sorry for her,
because you see I'm very fond of her, and I think
there's nothing&mdash;positively nothing&mdash;I wouldn't do to
help her."</p>

<p>"It's an intolerable existence for her."</p>

<p>"Intolerable? Ah, my dear Mr. Durant, you're delightfully
young; so is Frida, though you mightn't
think it; and you young people are all so tragic.
Frida's absurd about her father; she's always been
going about with that face of hers, playing at being
Antigone, and as the poor, dear Colonel is as blind as
What's-his-name? he naturally doesn't see it. She's
brought it all on herself. She looks on her father as
her fate, and treats him accordingly&mdash;in the grand
style&mdash;and it doesn't suit him. What a subject like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
the Colonel wants is a light touch. With me, for instance,
he's a dear."</p>

<p>"Is he? I thought he rather bored you," said Durant
maliciously.</p>

<p>"When did you think that? Oh, that first night
when we all laughed so much, except poor Frida. I
wasn't bored&mdash;not a bit; on the contrary, I was
amused at the expression of your face, and at your
atrocious manners and still more atrocious puns. Nothing
ever bores me. It's only you young people who let
yourselves be bored. Tragedy again. Too much tragedy
for my taste."</p>

<p>Mrs. <a class="corr" name="TC_4" id="TC_4" title="Frazakerly">Fazakerly</a> paused to let her communications
sink in and take root. There was a deep hush on the
landscape, as if in deference to her awful confidences.
A deer stood knee-deep in the grass and gazed at them
inquiringly. And as Mrs. Fazakerly stared unabashed
into the face of Nature, Durant thought of Frida's
remark, and wondered if she found it "soothing."</p>

<p>"Mind you, I don't mean to say that she's cold. On
the contrary, I believe she's capable of a tremendous
passion for something&mdash;I don't quite know what. It
might be a person,"&mdash;she rose&mdash;"but let me tell you it's
much more likely to be a thing."</p>

<p>They were talking quite innocently about art and
literature when they appeared at the house.</p>

<p>Durant vainly tried to unravel the possible motives
for her confidence. They were so many and so mixed.
It was possible that she honestly suspected him of a
dawning passion for Frida and that she meant to
warn him of the hopelessness of such an attachment;
apparently she understood her friend. Or the conversation
may have been designed as an apology for her
own future conduct. Durant knew that she would not
refuse to marry Colonel Tancred if he made the offer;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
he knew, or thought he knew, her inmost opinion of
that ridiculous person. She must be aware that her
own dignity was considerably compromised by the situation;
perhaps she hoped by rehabilitating the Colonel's
behavior to justify her own. But why that insistence
on the enigma of Frida Tancred's? Why this
superfluous and elaborate cover for her own very
simple meaning?</p>

<p>Unless, indeed, she was not quite so simple as she
seemed. In courtship the Colonel had shown himself
vacillating, to say the least of it. If Mrs. Fazakerly
wanted to bring him to the point it was obviously her
interest to get Miss Tancred out of her way. In other
words, to throw her in Durant's way. His delicacy
shrank from the baseness of this conjecture, but his
reason, as well as his experience, suggested that the
thing was not impossible. Mrs. Fazakerly had been
studying him, and she was shrewd enough to see that
the surest way to interest him in Miss Tancred was to
set his intellect to work on her. She had doubtless
observed his <i>fin de si&egrave;cle</i> contempt for the obvious, his
passion for the thing beyond his grasp, his worship of
the far-fetched, the intangible, the obscure. Thus she
thought to inflame his curiosity by hinting that Frida
Tancred was incomprehensible, while she touched the
very soul of desire by representing her as unattainable.
All this was no doubt very clever of Mrs. Fazakerly;
but it was not quite what he had expected of her.</p>

<p>His suspicions were confirmed by Frida's behavior.
Ever since their last interview she had relapsed into
something like her former reticence. To-night, as if
she had an inkling of the atrocious plot, she avoided
him with a sort of terror.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>


<h3>IX</h3>

<p>Durant's time was up, but the Colonel had pressed
him to stay another week. He was affectionate; he
was firm; he would take no refusal. He dwelt on the
advantages of a prolonged visit. "A little change,"
said he, "does us all good. You young fellows are apt
to get into a groove. But you seem brighter since you
came. I think we've shaken you up a bit."</p>

<p>Indeed, at no time had there been room for any
doubt as to the sincerity of his welcome. Though he
was so determined to shake Durant up, to get him out
of his groove, and give him fresh ideas, he betrayed a
pitiable dependence on the young fellow. He endeavored
to meet youth on its own ground; he made piteous
experiments in the frivolous. More than once Durant
had suspected that the poor gentleman had asked him
down as a protection from the terrors of his own
society. His intellectual resources were evidently giving
out. The barometer was stationary; a fortnight's
almost persistent sunshine had dried up the source of
ideas. Having gutted the <i>Nineteenth Century</i>, his
mind seemed to be impotently raging for fresh matter
to destroy. He repeated himself eternally; the same
phrases were always in his mouth. "A fad, a theory,
a name for ignorance." "Don't tell me; it's an insult
to my intelligence!" Durant could have been sorry
for him if he had not been so infinitely sorry for
himself.</p>

<p>On Monday morning Frida Tancred was herself
again; not her old self, but the new one that Durant
had learned to know and tolerate. She sought him
out after breakfast and seconded the Colonel's invitation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you could possibly stop, Mr. Durant, I wish you
would. I'm asking a favor. My cousin, Georgie Chatterton,
is coming down on Wednesday to stay. I don't
know how long. I've never seen her before, and she's
a young girl."</p>

<p>Frida's voice expressed a certain horror.</p>

<p>"Well, what of that?"</p>

<p>"If there's one thing on earth that I'm afraid of, it's
a young girl. If you could only stay on just to amuse
her a little, to help her through her first week! You
see, it'll be so desperately dull for her if you don't."</p>

<p>He laughed; there was no other way of responding
to the <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> of the request.</p>

<p>"It doesn't really seem fair to ask her when she
hasn't an idea&mdash;I can't think why father did it. Perhaps
he didn't. It's odd, but I've noticed that, when
anything like this happens, Mrs. Fazakerly is always
at the bottom of it."</p>

<p>Another lurid light on Mrs. Fazakerly!</p>

<p>"Was Mrs. Fazakerly at the bottom of his asking
me?"</p>

<p>She smiled. "To tell you the honest truth, she was.
Not but what he is delighted to have you here. I
don't know when I've seen him so happy, so interested
in anyone. But, you see, he's fearfully conservative;
he can't bear to take the first step in anything."</p>

<p>He saw. The Colonel might be as conservative as
he pleased; but the old order was changing; Coton
Manor was on the eve of a revolution. He saw it all
clearly, that deep-laid plot of Mrs. Fazakerly's. He
had been asked down at her suggestion to keep Frida
Tancred out of the way for the moment, or, better still,
forever. He had not risen to the occasion; his time
was up, so Miss Chatterton was to be invited to take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
his place. Yet, when he came to think of it, so simple
a scheme, the mere substitution of one cat's paw for
another, hardly did justice to Mrs. Fazakerly's imagination.
Was she still convinced of his dawning passion
for Miss Tancred? Had she doubts as to Miss
Tancred's willingness or power to return it? and had
she suggested that he should be pressed to prolong his
stay in the hope that the rival presence of the young
girl would act as the spark that fires the mine, kindling
Miss Tancred's emotions and revealing her to herself?</p>

<p>Meanwhile Miss Tancred's one idea was to make use
of him, to hand over the young girl to him and be rid
of her. Her former offer of the black mare on the
condition that he stayed another week appeared now
as a grim jest, a cynical wager. This time she was in
earnest. Whereas, if she had been in love with
him&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Weighing these matters in his sensitive brain, Durant
conceived a violent hatred of Mrs. Fazakerly and
her plot, together with a corresponding determination
to stay on, if only to prove to that ingenious lady that
she was hopelessly mistaken. Any hasty movement on
his part would but confirm her in her absurd suspicions,
while his actual flight would be the most flattering
testimony to the profundity of her insight. He was
not going to behave like the victim to a desperate
infatuation for Miss Tancred. He would stay on,
and Mrs. Fazakerly would see that nothing came of
her psychological intrigue.</p>

<p>How far the Colonel was her accomplice he had no
idea. The old fellow was a gentleman when all was
said and done, and it was more than likely that he
contented himself with a gentlemanly acquiescence.
His dignity might possibly not refuse to draw a profit
either way from the transaction. Durant could reckon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
on Miss Tancred, having returned to his original opinion
of her. There was not enough womanhood in her
for ordinary elemental jealousy; as for passion, he had
decided that she was as innocent of understanding as
she was incapable of inspiring it. A sentimental coxcomb
might beat a precipitate retreat because he
thought or fancied that his hostess was in love with
him, and he would probably call his ridiculous conduct
chivalry; it was more becoming in a gentleman to
ignore the painful circumstance. For all these reasons
he determined to stay.</p>

<p>His acceptance of their renewed invitation gave evident
pleasure to the Colonel and Miss Tancred and
very little annoyance to himself. He had grown used
to Coton Manor as a prisoner grows used to his cell.
He had, as he had feared, tied himself to the place by
beginning serious work in it. He was too well pleased
with his landscape studies of the neighborhood to leave
them unfinished; and, as it happened, he had plenty
of time to give to them, for the Colonel was pretty
constantly engaged with Mrs. Fazakerly. (Here again
he traced the delicate hand of that lady. She had
seen that, if any guest was to remain at Coton Manor,
a limit must be put to the Colonel's opportunities for
tormenting him.) Durant had ceased to long for distraction;
he was sufficiently entertained by the situation
itself.</p>


<h3>X</h3>

<p>If he had been on the lookout for distraction, he
would have found it in Georgie Chatterton. At Miss
Tancred's request he went with her to the station to
meet the expected guest. It was evidently thought
that his presence would break the shock of her arrival.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>It proved an unnecessary precaution. The young
girl presented a smiling face at the carriage window&mdash;the
Tancred face, somewhat obscured by a mass of
irrelevant detail, sandy hair, freckles, a sanguine complexion,
and so on. She jumped out on to the platform
with a joyous cry of "Fridah!" She embraced
"Fridah" impetuously, and then kept her a moment at
arm's length, examining her dubiously. "You don't
seem a bit glad to see me," was her verdict. She
smiled gaily at Durant, and held out a friendly hand.
All the way up from the station she conversed with
them in a light-hearted manner. Thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What do you people do down here?"</p>

<p>"Ask Mr. Durant; he'll tell you that we vegetate
all day and play whist all night."</p>

<p>"Oh, do you? Well, you know, I shan't. My goodness,
Frida! is that your house? Whatever is it like?
A Unitarian chapel, or the Carlton Club, or, stop a bit&mdash;you
don't bury people in it, do you?" Then, as it
occurred to her that she might have hurt her cousin's
feelings by her last suggestion, she added, "It's rather
a jolly old mausoleum, though. I wonder what it's like
inside."</p>

<p>If Miss Chatterton had any premonition of her own
approaching death by boredom, and had seen in Coton
Manor more than a mere passing resemblance to a
tomb, she was neither awestruck nor downcast at the
prospect of dissolution. She flung herself into the
vault as she had flung herself onto the platform, all
glowing with pleasurable anticipation. To Durant
there was something infinitely sad in the spectacle of
this young creature precipitating herself into the unknown
with such reckless and passionate curiosity.
The whole long evening through he could discover no
diminution of her mood, her gleeful determination to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
enjoy herself among the shades. She behaved to
Colonel Tancred as if he had been a celebrity whose
acquaintance she had long desired to make, a character
replete with interest and romantic charm. She
greeted Mrs. Fazakerly with a joyous lifting of the
eyebrows, as much as to say, "What! another delightful
person?"</p>

<p>And she was observant in her way, too. When Miss
Tancred put a hand on her shoulder and said, "It will
be horribly dull for you, Georgie; you'll have nothing
to do but talk to Mr. Durant," she replied, "H'm! Mr.
Durant looks as if he had been talked to all his life.
I shall talk to you, Frida."</p>

<p>All through dinner she managed to preserve her
spirits, her air of being among the most curious and
interesting people. Durant wondered how on earth
she kept it up. She seemed one of those fortunate
beings whose vivacity is so overpowering that it can
subdue even dulness to itself. She made the Colonel
look strangely old; beside her Mrs. Fazakerly seemed
suddenly to become dull and second-rate, to sink into
the position of an attendant, a fatuous chorus, a giddy
satellite. Her laughter swallowed up Mrs. Fazakerly's
as a river in flood devours its tributaries; her spirits
quenched Mrs. Fazakerly's as a blaze licks up a spasmodic
flicker. It pleased Durant to look at her, the
abandonment of her manners was in such flagrant contradiction
with the Roman regularity of her Tancred
face. Owing, perhaps, to some dash of the Tancred
blood in her, she was neither pretty nor witty; yet she
contrived to get her own way with everybody. Durant
accounted for it by her sheer youth, the obstinacy of
her will to live.</p>

<p>In twenty-four hours she had put a stop to Frida's
disappearances, to Durant's sketching, and to the Colonel's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
intellectual conversation; and this she did by
behaving so as to make these things impossible. In
short, she had taken possession of her cousin and her
black mare, of the Colonel and his cigarettes, of Mrs.
Fazakerly and her books, of everybody and everything
except Durant. She was friendly with him, but somehow
her friendliness was infinitely more unflattering
than Miss Tancred's former apathy. It implied that
he was all very well in his way, but that she had seen
too many of his sort to be greatly excited about him;
while in Frida Tancred, now, she had found something
absolutely and uniquely new. She was not going to
be put off with Durant; she fastened herself upon
Frida, and refused to let her go; she did the thing she
had said she would do&mdash;without absolutely ignoring
her fellow-guest, she talked to Frida or at Frida or for
Frida alone. And yet, strangely enough, by dint of
much observation she had detected a subtle resemblance
between them, and she proclaimed her discovery
with her natural frankness.</p>

<p>It was the second evening of her stay, and the three
were sitting out on the lawn together. She had been
looking long and earnestly at her mysterious kinswoman.</p>

<p>"Frida, you really are a sort of cousin, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"So I've always been told."</p>

<p>"And Mr. Durant, is he a sort of cousin, too?"</p>

<p>"I never heard that."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I have not the honor."</p>

<p>"That's odd. I thought he must be."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Miss Tancred.</p>

<p>"Oh, because there's a likeness somewhere. Not in
the face exactly, but&mdash;yes, there! Keep that expression
on your face one minute, Mr. Durant; now don't
you see it?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>

<p>"See what?"</p>

<p>"It&mdash;the likeness. He looks terribly reserved somehow&mdash;a
sort of wild-horses-shan't-draw-it-out-of-me
expression, and yet so fearfully restless; and that's just
like you."</p>

<p>There was an embarrassed silence; and then Miss
Chatterton again raised her cheerful voice.</p>

<p>"I say, <a class="corr" name="TC_5" id="TC_5" title="Fridah">Frida</a>! you might tell me exactly what I'm
in for. Are you two going to be horribly intellectual
and clever and that sort of thing?"</p>

<p>"I'm not," said Miss Tancred.</p>

<p>"I'm not," echoed Durant.</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven! Because you both look as if you'd
a tremendous lot in you. I wonder if you'll ever let
it out."</p>

<p>"Not if we can help it," said Durant.</p>

<p>"There you are again! If you're not Frida's first
cousin, you ought to be."</p>

<p>Durant smiled; he wondered whether the idea was
more than the random frolicking of Miss Chatterton's
brain. She was evidently a young woman of perception;
but her perceptions had wings, and she threw
them off from her in a manner altogether spontaneous,
impersonal and free. It was nothing to her if they
brushed against the truth sometimes in their irresponsible
flight.</p>

<p>"You don't mind all these personal remarks, do
you?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least," said Miss Tancred.</p>

<p>"For my part I rather like them," said Durant; but
they both carefully avoided each other's eyes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>


<h3>XI</h3>

<p>Durant had a grievance against Miss Chatterton.
He had been induced to lengthen his visit in order to
entertain her, and Miss Chatterton refused to be entertained.
His position at Coton Manor had thus become
a humiliating sinecure. There was no earthly reason
why he should stay any longer, and yet he stayed.</p>

<p>The fact was, that by this time he was really interested
in other things beside the landscape. He had
wondered how long Miss Chatterton would keep it up.
He watched her, as one haunted guest watches another,
to know if she too has seen the specter of the
house, observing her manner and her appetite at
breakfast, the expression of her face at bedtime, her
voice in saying good-morning and good-night. On the
third day he thought he could detect a slight flagging;
Miss Chatterton was a shade less buoyant, less talkative
than before. By the evening she was positively
serious, and he judged that the iron had entered into
her soul. Her manner to her cousin had changed; it
was more tentative, more tender, more maternal. She
had begun to pity Frida, as he had pitied her.</p>

<p>The two were inseparable; they were always putting
their heads together, always exchanging confidences.
And it was not only confidences but characters
that they exchanged. It was a positive fact that
as Miss Chatterton flagged Miss Tancred revived, she
seemed to be actually growing young while the young
girl grew older. Not that Miss Tancred grew young
without difficulty; the life she had led was against
that. She looked like a woman recovering from a
severe illness, she suffered relapse after relapse, she
went about in a flush and fever of convalescence; it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
was a struggle for health under desperate conditions,
the agony of a strong constitution still battling with
the atmosphere that poisoned it, recovery simulating
disease, disease counterfeiting recovery.</p>

<p>A wholesome process, no doubt, but decidedly unpleasant
to watch. Durant, however, had very little
opportunity for watching it, as he was now left completely
to himself. Miss Tancred's manner intimated
that she had done with him,&mdash;put him away in some
dark cupboard of the soul, like a once desired and
now dreaded stimulant,&mdash;that she was trusting to other
and safer means for building up her strength. If
Durant had ever longed for solitude, he had more than
enough of it now, and he devoted the rest of his time
to finishing the studies and sketches he had begun.
He had made none of Miss Tancred.</p>

<p>One morning he had pitched his umbrella and his
easel below a ridge on the far slope of the fir plantation.
A thorn bush sheltered him from the wind and
made him invisible from the terrace of grass above
him.</p>

<p>He had emerged from a fit of more than usual absorption
when he felt the stir of footsteps in the grass,
and a voice rang out clear from the terrace.</p>

<p>"If it would only make papa happy. I want him
to be happy."</p>

<p>Durant could not help but overhear, his senses
being sharpened by the dread of hearing.</p>

<p>"My poor child" (it was the young girl who spoke),
"you don't know what you want; but you want something
more than that."</p>

<p>Durant rattled his color-box in desperation, but the
women were too much absorbed to heed his warning,
and Frida even raised her voice in answering:</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm afraid I do want something more. I know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
what you're thinking, Georgie. When women of my
age go on like this it generally means that they're in
love, or that they want to be married, or both."</p>

<p>Durant was considering the propriety of bursting
out on them noisily from the cover of his umbrella,
but before he could decide the point Miss Tancred had
continued:</p>

<p>"I am not in love."</p>

<p>She spoke in the tone of one stating an extremely
uninteresting fact.</p>

<p>"You <i>are</i> in love, Frida. You're in love with life,
and life won't have anything to do with you; it's
thrown you over, and a beastly shame, too! You're
simply dying for love of it, my sweetheart."</p>

<p>Frida did not deny the accusation. They passed on,
and in the silence Durant could hear their skirts as
they brushed the thorn bush. He could only pray
now that he might remain invisible.</p>

<p>He felt rather than saw that they turned their heads
in passing.</p>

<p>"Do you think he heard?"</p>

<p>This time it was Miss Chatterton who raised her
voice.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter if he did. He's not a fool, whatever
else he is."</p>

<p>Durant overlooked that flattering tribute to himself
in his admiration of Miss Chatterton's masterly analysis
and comprehension. She had, so to speak, taken
Frida Tancred to pieces and put her together again in
a phrase&mdash;"Dying for love of life." Beside her luminous
intuition his own more logical method seemed
clumsy and roundabout, a constructive process riddled
by dangerous fallacies and undermined by monstrous
assumptions. At the same time he persisted in returning
to one of these, the most monstrous, perhaps, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
all. In spite, perhaps because, of her flat denial, he
pictured Frida not only as mysteriously in love with
existence, but with a certain humble spectator of existence.
According to the view he had once expounded
to her the two passions were inseparable.</p>

<p>Before very long he received a new light on the
subject. It was his last day, the two cousins were
together somewhere, the Colonel was in bed with a
bilious attack, and Durant was alone in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>He had not been alone long before Miss Chatterton
appeared. She came into the room with an air of
determination and sat down beside him. She went
straight to her point, a very prickly one; there was
no beating about the thorn bush with Miss Chatterton.</p>

<p>"Mr. Durant," said she, "I want to talk to you&mdash;for
once. When you first came here what did you think
of Miss Tancred?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I didn't think anything of Miss Tancred."</p>

<p>"Did you dislike her?"</p>

<p>"N-no. I only found her a little difficult to talk to."</p>

<p>"Oh. Well, that's not what I came to consult you
about. I want you to help me. I am going to
elope&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To elope with Miss Tancred&mdash;run away with her&mdash;take
her out of this. It's the only way."</p>

<p>"The only way to what?"</p>

<p>"To save her. But I shall do nothing rash, nothing
that would cause a scandal in the county. I shall
simply take her up to town with me when I go back
on Monday. My week isn't up; but&mdash;well&mdash;my temper
is. So far it's all open and aboveboard&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes. And where do I come in?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, <i>you</i>&mdash;if you wouldn't mind staying where you
are and keeping the Colonel in play till we've got safe
across the Channel&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The Channel?"</p>

<p>"The Channel, my friend. Where else should we
be safe?"</p>

<p>"That means that I've got to stick here till&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Till Wednesday."</p>

<p>"Good heavens! Another week! Not if I know it."</p>

<p>"Yes; it's awful, I know; but not as bad as it might
have been. You won't have to talk to Miss Tancred.
By the way, she says you are the only man who ever
tried to talk to her&mdash;to understand her. What a dreadful
light on her past! Think what her life must have
been."</p>

<p>"Not very amusing, I imagine."</p>

<p>"Amusing! <i>Think</i> of it. Thirty years in this hole,
where you can't breathe, and without a soul to speak
to except the Colonel. Not that the Colonel is a soul&mdash;he's
much too dense."</p>

<p>"To be anything but a body?"</p>

<p>"And all the time she has loathed it&mdash;loathed it.
You see, she's got cosmopolitan blood in her veins.
Her mother&mdash;you know about her mother?"</p>

<p>"I know nothing about her except that she did a
great many bad things&mdash;I mean pictures&mdash;for which I
hope Heaven may forgive her."</p>

<p>"Don't be brutal. She's dead now and can't do any
more. When she was alive she was a Russian or a
Pole or something funny, and mad on traveling, always
going from one place to another&mdash;a regular rolling
stone; till one day she rolled up to the Colonel's feet,
and then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>

<p>"He picked her up and put her in his pocket, and
she never rolled any further. He packed her off to
England and made her sit in this dreadful old family
seat of his till she died of it. That's the sort of
woman Miss Tancred's mother was, and Miss Tancred
takes after her mother. She's a cosmopolitan, too."</p>

<p>"Rubbish! No woman can be a cosmopolitan." He
said it in the same tone in which he had told Frida
that no woman could have a pure passion for Nature.
"And Miss Tancred, though nice, strikes me as peculiarly
provincial. I shouldn't have thought&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There are things in her you'd never have thought
of. It's wonderful how she comes out when you know
her."</p>

<p>"She certainly has come out wonderfully since you
came on the scene." (The words he used had a familiar
ring. It was exactly what Mrs. Fazakerly had
said to him.)</p>

<p>"I? I've not had anything to do with it. It was
you; she told me. It wasn't just that you understood
her; you made her understand herself; you made her
feel; you stirred up all the passion in her."</p>

<p>"I don't understand you," he said coldly.</p>

<p>"Well, I think if you can understand Miss Tancred
you might understand <i>me</i>. Compared with Frida I'm
simplicity itself."</p>

<p>"When did I do these things?"</p>

<p>"Why, when you told her to let herself go. When
you showed her your sketches and talked to her about
the places, and the sea, all the things you had seen; the
things she had dreamed of and never seen."</p>

<p>The young girl spoke as if she was indignant with
him for reveling in opportunities that were Frida's by
right.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p>"But she shall see them. She shall go away from
this, and be herself and nobody else in the world."</p>

<p>"It's too late&mdash;it's not as if she were young."</p>

<p>"Young? She's a good deal younger than I am,
though she's thirty and I'm twenty-four&mdash;twenty-five
next September. Frida's young because she's got the
body of a woman, the mind of a man, and the soul of
a baby. She'll begin where other women end, will
Frida. Wait till she's been abroad with me, and you'll
see how her soul will come on, in a more congenial
climate."</p>

<p>"Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"We're going everywhere. Venice&mdash;Rome&mdash;Florence&mdash;the
Mediterranean&mdash;the regular thing. And to
all sorts of queer outlandish places besides&mdash;Scandinavia,
the Hebrides, and Iceland; everywhere that you
can go to by sea. The sea&mdash;&mdash;That's you again."</p>

<p>"The deuce it is! I doubt if I've done the kind
thing, then. I seem to have roused passions which
will never be satisfied. When she comes back&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Miss Chatterton's voice sank. "She never will come
back."</p>

<p>"Never? How about the Colonel?"</p>

<p>Miss Chatterton smiled. "That's the beauty of it.
It's the neatest, sweetest, completest little plot that
ever was invented, and it's simplicity itself, like its
inventor&mdash;that's me. I suppose you know all about
Mrs. Fazakerly?"</p>

<p>"Well, not all. Who <i>could</i> know all about Mrs.
Fazakerly?"</p>

<p>"You know enough, I daresay. By taking her away&mdash;I
mean Frida&mdash;we force the Colonel's hand."</p>

<p>"You might explain."</p>

<p>"I never saw a man who wanted so many things
explained. Don't you see that, as long as Frida stays
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
at home, petting and pampering him and doing all his
work for him, he'll never take the trouble to marry;
but as soon as she goes away, and stays away&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I see, I see; he marries. You force his hand&mdash;and
heart."</p>

<p>"Exactly. And, if he marries, Frida stays away altogether.
She's free."</p>

<p>"Yes; she's free. If she goes; but she'll never go."</p>

<p>"Won't she? She's going next Monday. It's all
arranged. I've told her that she's in her father's way,
that he wants to marry, and keeps single for her sake.
And she believes it."</p>

<p>He walked up and down with his hands in his pockets,
a prey to bewildering emotions.</p>

<p>"It's ingenious and delightful, your plot," said he.
"But I can't say that I grasp all the <i>minuti&aelig;</i>, the practical
details. For instance (it's a brutal question, but),
who's going to provide the&mdash;the funds for this expedition
to Scandinavia&mdash;or was it Abyssinia?"</p>

<p>"Funds? Oh, that's all right. She's got any amount
of her own, though you wouldn't know it."</p>

<p>"I didn't know it." He champed his upper lip. He
could not in the least account for the feeling, but he
was bitterly, basely disappointed at this last revelation.
Miss Tancred was independent. Up till now he
could not bring himself to believe in her flight; he did
not want to believe in it; it would have been a relief
to him to know that the strange bird's wings were
clipped.</p>

<p>"It was her mother's; what the poor lady traveled
on, I suppose. Frida might have been enjoying it all
the time, only, you see, there was the Colonel. That's
why she wants him to marry Mrs. Fazakerly, though
she'd rather die than own it."</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't she own it?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

<p>"Because she can't trust her motives, trust herself.
I never saw a woman fight so shy of herself."</p>

<p>"Then that's what she was thinking of when she
said she was afraid of her own feelings."</p>

<p>"Oh! So she <i>did</i> say it, did she?"</p>

<p>"She said that or something very like it. You think
that's what she must have meant?" He appealed to
her humbly, as to one who had mastered the difficult
subject of Frida Tancred.</p>

<p>"Why, whatever else <i>could</i> she have meant, stupid?"</p>

<p>There was an awkward silence, broken, or rather
mended, by Miss Chatterton saying, as she stood with
her hand on the door:</p>

<p>"Look here, you're not going to back out of it.
You've promised to stand by and see us through with
it, honor bright."</p>

<p>"I promised nothing of the sort, but I'll stand by
all right."</p>

<p>"You may have a bad time. The Colonel will kick
up an awful fuss; but remember, you're not in the least
responsible. I'm the criminal."</p>

<p>It was as if she had said, "Don't exaggerate your
importance. I, not you, am Miss Tancred's savior and
deliverer."</p>

<p>He stiffened visibly. "I shall not quarrel with you
for the <i>r&ocirc;le</i>."</p>


<h3>XII</h3>

<p>Monday was the day of the great deliverance, the
day that was fixed for Frida Tancred's flight. And, as
if it meant to mark an era and a hegira and the beginning
of revolution, it distinguished itself from other
days by suitable signs and portents. It dawned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
through a brooding haze that threatened heat, then
changed its mind, thickened and massed itself for
storm. While he was dressing, Durant was made aware
of the meteorological disturbance by an incessant tap-tap
on the barometer as the Colonel consulted his
oracle in the hall. The official announcement was
made at breakfast.</p>

<p>"There is a change in the glass," said the Colonel.
"Mr. Durant brought the fine weather with him and
Miss Chatterton is taking it away."</p>

<p>"I'm taking something else away beside the weather,"
said she.</p>

<p>But the spirit of prophecy was upon him.</p>

<p>"To judge by to-day's forecast, I think we shall see
Frida back again before the fine weather."</p>

<p>Whereupon Durant smiled and Miss Chatterton
laughed, which gave him an agreeable sense of being
witty as well as prophetic.</p>

<p>By ten o'clock the hand of the barometer had crept
far past "Change"; by noon it had swung violently to
"Stormy, with much rain"; by lunchtime a constrained
and awkward dialogue was broken by the rude voice
of the thunder. The Colonel took out his watch, timed
the thunder and lightning, and calculated the approaches
of the storm. "Seven miles away from us at
present," said he.</p>

<p>It hung so low that the growling and groaning
seemed to come from the woods round Coton Manor;
the landscape darkened to a metallic purplish green,
then paled to the livid color of jade under a sallow
sky. There was a swift succession of transformation
scenes, when, between the bursts of thunder, the park,
swathed in sheet lightning, shot up behind the windows,
now blue, now amethyst, now rose, now green.
Then the storm suddenly shifted its quarters and broke
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
through a rampart of solid darkness piled high in the
southwest.</p>

<p>"Fifteen seconds," said the Colonel, "between that
flash and the thunder."</p>

<p>Among these phenomena the Colonel moved like a
little gentleman enchanted; he darted to and fro, and
in and out, as if the elements were his natural home;
his hurried notes in the little memorandum book outsped
the lightning. For the last thirty years there had
not been such weather in the meteorological history of
Wickshire.</p>

<p>But the storm was only in its playful infancy; the
forked lightning and the rain were yet to come. The
last train up, timed to meet the express at the junction,
left Whithorn-in-Arden at 3.10, and it was a good
hour's drive to the station. As they toyed with the
lightning on their plates Durant and Miss Chatterton
looked at Frida. Fate, the weather, and the Colonel,
a trinity of hostile powers, were arrayed against her,
and the three were one.</p>

<p>At the stroke of two the Colonel remarked blandly,
"There will be no driving to the station to-day, so I
have countermanded the brougham."</p>

<p>They were dressed ready for the journey, and, as the
Colonel spoke Frida got up, drew down her veil and
put on her gloves.</p>

<p>"That was a pity," she said quietly, "seeing that
we've got to go."</p>

<p>The Colonel was blander than ever; he waved his
hand. "Go, by all means," said he, "but not in my
brougham. There I put my foot down."</p>

<p>("Not there, not there, oh, gallant Colonel," said
Durant to himself, "but where you have always put it,
on Frida's lovely neck.")</p>

<p>She started, looked steadily at her father, then, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
Durant's surprise, she shrugged her shoulders; not as
an Englishwoman shrugs them, but in the graceful
Continental manner. The movement suggested that
the foreign strain in her was dominant at the moment;
it further implied that she was shaking her neck free
from the Colonel's foot. She walked to the window
and looked out upon the storm. With the neck
strained slightly forward, her nostrils quivering, her
whole figure eager and lean and tense, she looked like
some fine and nervous animal, say a deerhound ready
to slip from the leash.</p>

<p>As she looked there was a sound as if heaven were
ripped asunder, and the forked lightning hurled itself
from that dark rampart in the southwest and went
zig-zagging against the pane. "Only ten seconds," said
the Colonel; "the storm is bursting right over our
heads."</p>

<p>Frida too had consulted her watch; she turned suddenly,
rang the bell, and gave orders to a trembling
footman. "Tell Randall to put Polly in the dogcart.
He must drive to the station at once."</p>

<p>The answer came back from the stables that Randall
had shut himself into the loose box and covered
himself with straw, "to keep the lightning off of him.
He dursn't go near a steel bit, not if it was to save
his life, m'm, and as for driving to the station&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was too true; Randall, horse-breaker, groom and
coachman, excellent, invaluable creature at all other
times, was a brainless coward in a thunderstorm.</p>

<p>"If we don't go to-day, we can't go till to-morrow,"
said Georgie Chatterton, and she nodded at Durant
to remind him that in that case his departure would
be postponed till Thursday.</p>

<p>Frida too turned toward him. "If I don't go to-day,
I shall never go."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>

<p>He understood. She was afraid, afraid of what
might come between her and her deliverance, afraid
of her fate, afraid of the conscience that was her will,
afraid of her own fear, of the terror that would come
upon her when she realized the full meaning of her
lust for life. To-morrow any or all of those things
might turn her from the way; to-day she was strong;
she held her life in her two hands. At any rate, she
was not afraid of the weather. She would go straight
to her end, through rain and lightning and thunderbolts
and all the blue and yellow demons of the sky.</p>

<p>"Are you afraid, Georgie?"</p>

<p>"Of thunder and lightning?" asked Georgie pointedly.
"No."</p>

<p>"All right, then. We've got forty-five minutes. I
must put Polly into the cart myself. Five for that;
forty to get to the station."</p>

<p>She strode off to the stables, followed by the footman
and Durant. Among them they forced Polly into
the trap, and led her dancing to the porch, where Miss
Chatterton stood, prepared for all weathers.</p>

<p>"I say," cried she, "this is all very well; but who's
going to drive Polly there and back again?"</p>

<p>"I am," said Durant calmly. He had caught a furtive
flash from Frida's eyes that lighted upon, glanced
off him and fell to the ground. The woman in her
had appealed to his chivalry. At the same instant
there was a swish, as if the skirts of heaven were trailing
across the earth, and the rain came down. He
hastily thrust Miss Tancred's arms into the sleeves of
her mackintosh and wriggled into his own. The final
speeches were short and to the point.</p>

<p>"Mr. Durant," said Miss Chatterton, "you are a
hero."</p>

<p>"Frida," said the Colonel, "you are a fool." And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
for once Durant was inclined to agree with him. The
more so as Miss Tancred took advantage of his engagement
with his mackintosh to enthrone herself on
the driver's high seat. She said good-by to the Colonel,
and gathered up the reins; Miss Chatterton
climbed up beside her; Polly gave a frantic plunge and
a dash forward; and the hero was obliged to enter the
dogcart after the deft fashion of a footman, with a
run and a flying leap into the back seat.</p>

<p>Miss Chatterton was unkind enough to laugh. "Well
done!" said she. "Sit tight, and try to look as chivalrous
as I'm sure you feel."</p>

<p>But it is hard to look or feel chivalrous sitting on a
back seat in a wet mackintosh with a thunderstorm
pouring down your neck and into your ears, and a
woman, possessed by all the devils, driving furiously to
an express train that she can never catch. In that
lunatic escape from Coton Manor she had not looked
back once; she left Durant to contemplate a certain
absurd little figure that stood under an immense Doris
portico, regarding the face of the sky.</p>

<p>The main thoroughfare of Whithorn-in-Arden was
scored like the bed of a torrent, and fringed with an
ochreish scum tossed up from the churning loam. The
church clock struck three as they dashed through.</p>

<p>"You'll never do it," said Durant; "it's a good twenty
minutes from here."</p>

<p>"In the brougham it is. Polly will do it in ten&mdash;with
me driving her."</p>

<p>She did it in seven. Durant had pictured the two
ladies scurrying along the platform, and himself, a dismal
figure, aiding their unlovely efforts to board a
departing train; as it was, the three minutes saved
allowed Frida to achieve her flight with dignity.</p>

<p>For two out of those three minutes he stood outside
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
their carriage window, beyond the shelter of the
station roof, with the rain from the ornamental woodwork
overflowing on to his innocent head. He was
trying to smile.</p>

<p>"Heroic," murmured Miss Chatterton; and her eyebrows
intimated that she saw pathos in his appearance.
As for Frida, her good-by was so curt and cold
that Durant, who had suffered many things in redeeming
the discourtesy of his former attitude to her,
was startled and not a little hurt. His plain, lean
face, that seemed to have grown still plainer and leaner
under the lashing of the rain, set again in its habitual
expression of repugnance; hers paled suddenly to a
lighter sallow than before; the hand she had given to
him withdrew itself in terror from his touch. He drew
himself up stiffly, raising a hat that was no hat but a
gutter, and the train crawled out of the station.</p>

<p>He stood yet another minute staring at the naked
rails, two shining parallel lines that seemed to touch
and vanish, over the visible verge, into the gray fringe
of the infinite where the rain washed out the world.</p>

<p>And then he saw nothing but Frida Tancred, sitting
on the edge of the fir plantation and gazing into the
distance; he heard his own voice saying to her, "Let
yourself go, Miss Tancred; let yourself go!"</p>

<p>And she was gone.</p>


<h3>XIII</h3>

<p>All that Durant got out of Polly was the privilege
of driving her home, through mud and rain, at a melancholy
trot. True, he was in no hurry to get back;
so he let her take her own pace, in pity for her trembling
limbs and straining heart. Polly had done all she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
knew for her mistress in that frantic dash for freedom
and the express; and, when he thought of what Frida
Tancred's life had been, he guessed that the little animal
was used to carrying her through worse storms
than this.</p>

<p>The storm was over now; it had driven the clouds
into the north, where they hung huddled and piled in
a vast amphitheater; other clouds, charged with light
now instead of darkness, were still rolling up from the
south, east and west, their wings closed till the sky
was shut in like Whithorn-in-Arden, ringed with its
clouds as Arden with its woods; above, beneath, there
rose the same immense, impenetrable boundary, green
on the earth and gray in heaven.</p>

<p>And Frida Tancred had escaped from these confines,
would never come back to dwell in them again; she
had said so, and he believed her. To be sure, she had
shown weakness at the last, she had been driven to
juggle with the conscience that would not let her go;
had she not persuaded it that she was leaving the Colonel
for the Colonel's good? But once gone, once there,
away over the border and safe in the promised land,
she would see clearly, she would realize her right to be
happy in the glorious world.</p>

<p>Not that these things could have happened without
Georgie Chatterton. He had nothing but admiration
for that young woman; there had been daring in her
conquest of Frida Tancred, there were ingenuity and
determination in the final elopement. Was it possible
that he was piqued at the insignificance of the part
she had assigned to him? She had left him to settle
up the sordid accounts while she ran away with the
lady. He had got to say to Colonel Tancred, "Colonel
Tancred, I am not your daughter's seducer and abductor;
I am only a miserable accessory after the fact." In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
other words, Miss Chatterton had reminded him that
he was too late.</p>

<p>Too late indeed, it seemed. Whether or not Miss
Chatterton's faith in him had failed her at the last
moment, but when he came down to dinner that
evening he found that she had been beforehand with
him; there was nothing left for him to do.</p>

<p>The Colonel looked up smiling from a telegram.
"News from St. Pancras. Miss Chatterton is carrying
my daughter off to the Continent."</p>

<p>"I'm delighted to hear it. It will do her all the good
in the world."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; I'm glad she should have the opportunity.
I made a little tour on the Continent myself when I
was a young man, and I've felt a brighter fellow for
it ever since."</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"Yes. One's apt to get into a groove staying at
home so much. There's nothing like rubbing brains
with foreigners. It stretches you out, clears you of
all your narrow insular prejudices, brings you in touch"&mdash;Durant
quivered; he knew it was coming&mdash;"in
touch with fresh ideas. I don't know how you feel
about it, but six months of it was enough to convince
me that there's no place like England, and no people
like English people, and no house like my own. As
for Frida, a very little goes a long way with Frida;
she'll be sick of it in six weeks, but she'll settle down
all the better for the change."</p>

<p>"You think so?"</p>

<p>"I do. She may be a little unsettled at first. Her
poor mother was just the same&mdash;restless, restless. But
she settled down."</p>

<p>The Colonel made no further allusion to his daughter's
absence. He was presently disturbed about another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
matter, bustling about the room, wondering,
questioning, and exclaiming, "I have lost my little
meteorological chronicle? Has anybody seen my little
meteorological chronicle? Now, where did I have it
last? I wonder if I could have left it with my other
papers in Frida's room?"</p>

<p>But Frida's room, the room where she did all her
father's writing, and her own reading and dreaming
when she had time to read and dream, Frida's room
was locked, and nobody could find the key. The Colonel,
more than ever convinced that his meteorological
chronicle was concealed in Frida's room, ordered the
door to be burst open. Durant lent a shoulder to the
work and entered somewhat precipitately, followed by
the Colonel.</p>

<p>The meteorological chronicle, the labor of years, was
found where its author had left it, on his writing-table,
together with his other papers, business letters, household
accounts, Primrose League programs, all carefully
sorted, dated, and docketed. Many of the letters
had been answered; they lay, addressed in Frida's
handwriting, ready for the post. She had left her work
in such perfect order that a new secretary could have
been fitted into her place without a hitch. The fact
was eloquent of finality and the winding up of affairs;
but certain other details were more eloquent still.</p>

<p>Order on the writing-table; in the rest of the room
confusion and disarray, rifled bookcases and dismantled
walls. Fresh squares of wall-paper outlined in cobwebs
marked the places where the great maps had
hung. The soul of the room was gone from it with
the portrait of the late Mrs. Tancred; the watercolor
drawings, sad work of her restless fingers, were no
longer there. The furniture had been pushed aside to
make room for the deed of desecration; the floor was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
littered with newspapers and straw; an empty packing-case
lay on its side, abandoned, in a corner.</p>

<p>The Colonel opened round eyes of astonishment, but
his mustache was still. He rang the bell and summoned
the servants. Under severe cross-examination,
Chaplin, the footman, gave evidence that three packing-cases
had left Coton Manor for the station early
in the morning before the bursting of the storm. Frida,
too, had discerned the face of the sky, and&mdash;admirable
strategist!&mdash;had secured her transports. The Colonel
dismissed his witnesses, and appealed helplessly to
Durant; indeed, the comprehension in the young man's
face gave him an appearance of guilty complicity.</p>

<p>"What does it mean, Durant? what does it mean?"</p>

<p>Durant smiled, not without compassion. When a
young woman arranges her accounts, and makes off
with three packing-cases, containing her library and
her mother's portrait, the meaning obviously is that
she is not coming back again in a hurry. He suggested
that perhaps Miss Tancred proposed to make a
lengthier stay on the Continent than had been surmised.</p>

<p>"The whole thing," said the Colonel, "is incomprehensible
to me."</p>

<p>For the rest of the evening he remained visibly subdued
by the presence of the incomprehensible; after
coffee he pulled himself together and prepared to
face it.</p>

<p>"There will be no whist this evening," he announced.
"You will excuse me, Durant; I have an immensity
of work on hand. Chaplin, put some whiskey and
water in the study, and light the little lamp on my
literary machine."</p>

<p>Tuesday morning's post brought explanation. Two
letters lay on the breakfast table, both from a fresh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
hotel, the <i>H&ocirc;tel M&eacute;tropole</i>, both addressed in Frida
Tancred's handwriting, one to the Colonel and the
other to Durant. Durant's ran thus:</p>

<div class="letter"><p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Durant</span>:&mdash;You will explain everything
to my father, won't you? I have done my best, but
he will never see it; it is the sort of thing he never
could see&mdash;my reasons for going away and staying
away. They are hard to understand, but, as far as
I have made them out myself, it seems that I went
away for his sake; but I believe, in fact I know, that
I shall stay away for my own. You will understand
it; we thrashed it all out that Saturday afternoon&mdash;you
remember?&mdash;and you understood then. And so I
trust you.</p>

<p class="sig">
"Always sincerely yours,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Frida Tancred</span>.<br />
</p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;Write and tell me how he takes it. I can see
it&mdash;so clearly!&mdash;from his point of view. I hope he
will not be unhappy.</p>

<p>"P.P.S.&mdash;We sail to-morrow."</p></div>

<p>He was still knitting his brows over the opening
sentences when the Colonel flicked his own letter across
the table.</p>

<p>"Read this, Durant, and tell me what you think
of it."</p>

<p>Durant read:</p>

<div class="letter"><p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Father</span>:&mdash;You will see from Georgie's
telegram that we shall be leaving England to-morrow.
I did not tell you this before because it would have
meant so much explanation, and if we once began
explaining things I don't think I should ever have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
gone at all. And I had to go. Believe me, I was convinced
that in going I was doing the best thing for
you. I thought you had been making sacrifices for
my sake, and that you would be happier without me,
though you would not say so. Whether I could have
brought myself to leave you without the help of this
conviction, and whether I have the conviction strongly
still, I cannot say; it is hard to be perfectly honest,
even with myself. But now that I have gone I simply
can't come back again. Not yet. Perhaps never, till
I have done the things I want to do.</p>

<p>"Of course you will be angry&mdash;it is so unexpected.
But only think&mdash;you would not be angry, would you,
if I married? You would have considered that perfectly
legitimate. Yet it would have meant my leaving
you for good. And what marriage and settling
down in it is to other women, seeing the world and
wandering about in it is to me&mdash;it's the thing I care
for most. We do not talk about these things, so this
is the first you have heard of it. Think&mdash;if I had been
very much in love with anyone I would have said
nothing about it till I was all but engaged to him.
It's the same thing. And it will make less difference
to you than my marriage would have made."</p></div>

<p>Here Frida's pen had come to a stop; with a sudden
flight from the abstract to the concrete, she had
begun a fresh argument on a fresh page.</p>

<div class="letter"><p>"I only mean to use a third of my income. The
other two thousand will still go to keeping up the
property. I have left everything so that my work
could be taken up by anybody to-morrow."</p></div>

<p>The Colonel's eyes had dogged Durant's down to
the bottom of the sheet, when he made a nervous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
attempt to recapture the letter. It was too late; the
swing of Frida's impassioned pleading had carried
Durant over the page, and one terse sentence had
printed itself instantaneously on his brain. He handed
back the letter without a word.</p>

<p>The Colonel drew Durant's arm in his and led him
out through the window on to the gravel drive. Up
and down, up and down, they walked for the space of
one hour, while the Colonel poured out his soul. He
went bareheaded, he lifted up his face to the heavens,
touched to a deeper anguish by the beauty of the
young day.</p>

<p>"Lord, what a perfect morning! Look at this place
she's left; look at it! I've nursed the little property
for her; it was as much hers as if I was in my grave,
Durant. She's lived in it for nearly thirty years, ever
since she was no higher than that flower-pot, and she
thinks nothing of leaving it. She thinks nothing of
leaving <i>me</i>. And I've got more work to do than my
brain's fit for; why I was in the very thick of my
Primrose League correspondence, up to the neck in all
manner of accounts; and she knew it, and chose this
time. I've got to give a lecture next week in Whithorn
parish-room, a lecture on 'Imperialism,' and I've my
little chronicle on hand, too; but it's nothing to her.
The whole thing's a mystery to me. I can't think what
can have made her do it. She never was a girl that
cared for gadding about, and for society and that. As
for trying to make me believe that I should be no
worse off if she married, the question has never risen,
Durant. She hasn't married. She never even wanted
to be married. She never would have been married."</p>

<p>"That makes it all the more natural that she should
want to see something of the world instead."</p>

<p>"No, it's not natural. I could have understood her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
wanting to get married, that's natural enough; but
what's a woman got to do with seeing the world? It's
not as if she was my son, Durant."</p>

<p>Durant listened and wondered. As far as he could
make out, the Colonel's attitude to his daughter was
twofold. On the one hand, he seemed to regard her
as part of the little property, and as existing for the
sake of the little property, from which point of view
she had acquired a certain value in his eyes. On the
other hand, he looked upon her as an inferior part of
Himself, and as existing for the sake of Himself; it
was a view old as the hills and the earth they were
made of, being the paternal side of the simple primeval
attitude of the man to the woman. And, seeing that
the little property was a mere drop in the ocean of
the Colonel's egoism, this view might be said to include
the other as the greater includes the less. On either
theory Frida Tancred was not supposed to have any
rights, or, indeed, any substantial existence of her own;
she was an attribute, an adjunct.</p>

<p>"Seeing the world&mdash;fiddlesticks! Don't tell me there
isn't something else at the bottom of it&mdash;it's an insult
to my intelligence."</p>

<p>As everything the Colonel did not understand was
an insult to his intelligence, his intelligence must have
had to put up with an extraordinary number of affronts.</p>

<p>He leaned heavily on the young man's arm. "It's
shaken me. I shall never be the fellow I was. I can't
understand it. Nobody could have done more for any
girl than I've done for Frida; and she deserts me,
Durant, deserts me in my old age with my strength
failing."</p>

<p>Durant vainly tried to make himself worthy of Frida
Tancred's trust, but he could add nothing to her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
reasoning, and she had kept her best argument to the
last,&mdash;"It will make less difference to you than my
marriage would have made."</p>

<p>"After all, sir, will it make so very much difference
if&mdash;if your daughter does go away for a year or two?"</p>

<p>"I can't say. I can't tell you that till I've tried it,
my boy. It's all too new to me, and I tell you I can't
understand it."</p>

<p>He trailed off with a slow and stricken movement,
like a lesser Lear, and re&euml;ntered the house by the window
of Frida's room. The sight of the well-ordered
writing-table subtilized for a moment his sense of her
desertion.</p>

<p>"Look at that. She was my right hand, Maurice,
and I can't realize that she's gone. It's the queerest
sensation; I feel as if she was here and yet wasn't
here."</p>

<p>Durant said he had heard that people felt like that
after the amputation of their right hands. As for the
wound, he hoped that time would heal it.</p>

<p>"Any soldier can tell you that old wounds will still
bleed, Durant. I think that was the luncheon bell."</p>

<p>Lunch, over which the Colonel lingered lovingly and
long, somewhat obscured the freshness of the tragedy,
and made it a thing of the remoter past. An hour
later he was playing with his little rain-gauge on the
lawn. At afternoon teatime he appeared immaculately
attired in the height of the fashion; brown boots, the
palest of pale gray summer suitings, a white piqu&eacute;
waistcoat, the least little luminous hint of green in
his silk necktie, and he seemed the spirit of youth
incarnate.</p>

<p>At this figure Durant smiled with a pity that was
only two-thirds contempt. He longed to ask him
whether the old wound was bleeding badly. He was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
bound to believe that the Colonel had a heart under
his immaculate waistcoat, with pulses and arteries the
same as other people's, his own unconquerable conviction
being that if you pricked the gentlemannikin
he would bleed sawdust.</p>

<p>The Colonel had scarcely swallowed his tea when
Durant saw him trotting off in the direction of the
cottage; there was that about him which, considering
his recent bereavement, suggested an almost indecent
haste. He returned and sat down to dinner, flushed
but uncommunicative. He seemed aware that it was
Durant's last night, and it was after some weak attempts
to give the meal a commemorative and farewell
character, half-festal, half-funereal, that he sank
into silence, and remained brooding over the ice pudding
in his attitude of owl-like inscrutability. But
during the privacy of dessert his mystic mood took
flight; he hopped, as it were, onto a higher perch; he
stretched the wing of victory and gazed at it admiringly;
there was an effect as of the preening of young
plumage, the fluttering of innumerable feathers.</p>

<p>And, with champagne running in his veins like the
sap of spring, he proclaimed his engagement to that
charming lady, Mrs. Fazakerly.</p>

<p>Durant had no sooner congratulated him on the
event than he remembered that he had left the postscript
of Miss Tancred's letter unanswered. She had
said, "Write and tell me how he takes it"; she had
hoped that he would not be unhappy. So he wrote:
"He took it uncommonly well" (that was not strictly
true, but Durant was determined to set Frida Tancred's
conscience at rest, even if he had to tamper a
little with his own). "I should not say that he will be
very unhappy. On the contrary, he has just assured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
me that he is the happiest man on earth. He is engaged
to be married to Mrs. Fazakerly."</p>

<p>It was a masterly stroke on Mrs. Fazakerly's part,
and it had followed so closely on the elopement (as
closely, indeed, as consequence on cause) that Durant
had to admit that he had grossly underrated the powers
of this remarkable woman. He had been lost in admiration
of Miss Chatterton's elaborate intrigue and bold
independent action; but now he came to think of it,
though Miss Chatterton's style was more showy, Mrs.
Fazakerly had played by far the better game of the
two. Durant, who had regarded himself as a trump
card up Mrs. Fazakerly's sleeve, perceived with a pang
that he had counted for nothing in the final move.
Mrs. Fazakerly had not, as he idiotically supposed, been
greatly concerned with Frida Tancred's attitude toward
him. She had divined nothing, imagined nothing, she
had been both simpler and subtler than he knew. She
had desired the removal of Frida Tancred from her
path, and at the right moment she had produced
Georgie Chatterton. She had played her deliberately,
staking everything on the move. Georgie's independence
had been purely illusory. She had appeared at
Mrs. Fazakerly's bidding, she had behaved as Mrs.
Fazakerly had foreseen, she had removed Frida Tancred,
and Durant had been nowhere. Mrs. Fazakerly's
little gray eyes could read the characters of men and
women at a glance, and as instantly inferred their fitness
or unfitness for her purpose. She might be a poor
hand at the game of whist, but at the game of matrimony
she was magnificent and supreme.</p>

<p>Frida had said, "We sail to-morrow"; therefore,
Durant walked all the way to Whithorn-in-Arden to
post his letter, so that it might reach her before she
left London. And as he came back across the dewy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
path in the dim light, and Coton Manor raised its
forehead from the embrace of the woods and opened
the long line of its dull windows, he realized all that
it had done for Frida. He understood the abnegation
and the tragedy of her life. She had been sacrificed,
not only to her father, but to her father's fetish, the
property; Coton Manor had to be kept up at all costs,
and the cost had been Frida's, it had been her mother's.
The place had crushed and consumed her spirit, as it
swallowed up two-thirds of her material inheritance;
it had made the living woman as the dead. He remembered
how the house had been called her mother's
monument, and how it had become her own grave. Her
soul had never lived there. And now that she was
gone it was as empty as the tomb from which the soul
has lifted the body at resurrection time.</p>

<p>And he, too, was set at liberty.</p>

<p>He left by the slow early train on Wednesday without
waiting for the afternoon express, his object being
not so much to reach town as to get away from Coton
Manor. The Colonel accompanied him to the station;
and, to his infinite surprise and embarrassment, he
found Mrs. Fazakerly on the platform waiting to see
him off.</p>

<p>He could think of nothing nice to say to her about
her engagement, not even when she took possession
of him with a hand on his arm, led him away to the
far end of the platform, and gazed expectantly into
his face.</p>

<p>"You don't congratulate me, Mr. Durant."</p>

<p>"On what?" he asked moodily.</p>

<p>"On having done a good deed."</p>

<p>"A good deed?"</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you there was nothing I wouldn't do
for Frida Tancred?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>

<p>Incomparable cunning! To set herself right in his
eyes and her own, she was trying to persuade him that
she had accepted the Colonel for his daughter's sake.
A good deed! Well, whatever else she had done, and
whatever her motives may have been, the deed remained;
she had set Frida Tancred free. Nevertheless,
he could not be pleasant.</p>

<p>"Self-sacrifice, no doubt, is a virtue," said he; "yet
one draws the line&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Does one?"</p>

<p>He felt a delicate pressure on his arm, the right
touch, the light touch. "Mr. Durant, you are dense,
and you are ungrateful."</p>

<p>"I don't see it."</p>

<p>"Don't you see what I have done for you?" There
was a strange light behind the <i>pince-nez</i> as she smiled
up into his face. "I have cleared the way."</p>

<p>"For Miss Tancred, you mean," said Durant; thereby
proving that in her calculations as to his mean density
Mrs. Fazakerly was not altogether wrong.</p>

<p>But Durant was always an imaginative man. And
as he sped on the same journey over the same rails, his
imagination followed Frida Tancred in her flight
toward freedom and the unknown.</p>

<h3>XIV</h3>

<p>After seven weeks in England Maurice Durant began
to look back with longing on the seven years he
had spent away from it, and so turned his back on
Dover and his face to the South of France. Those
three weeks in Coton Manor had disgusted him with
the country, another three weeks in London had more
than satisfied his passion for town. It was there that
he realized more keenly than anywhere else that he
was a foreigner in England, and he went abroad in
order to feel himself an Englishman again.</p>

<p>Restless as ever, he spent two years wandering the
world, then shut himself up for three more in a little
villa in the Apennines, and worked as he had never
worked before, with the result that at the end of the
five years, he found himself irresistibly drawn back to
England again. Gradually&mdash;very gradually&mdash;England
was waking to the fact that Maurice Durant was a
clever painter; still more gradually it had dawned on
Maurice that he was becoming famous. His name had
traveled to London, as a name frequently does, vi&acirc;
Paris and New York, and Fame had lured him to London
by dint of taking it up and incessantly sounding
it, not with a coarse and startling blast from her favorite
instrument, the trumpet, but with a delicate crescendo,
lyrically, subtly, insinuatingly, like a young siren
performing on a well-modulated flute. The trumpet,
no doubt, would have deafened or irritated him; but
before he got sick of it the softer music was by no
means disagreeable to his ear.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>

<p>It seemed that he had scored a double success, being
equally happy in his landscapes and his portraits. The
critics were divided. One evening it would appear that,
within the limits of his art, Maurice Durant was the
subtlest, the finest exponent of modern womanhood;
the next morning he would be told that he had rendered
the beauty of the divine visible world more imaginatively,
more individually, than any living artist,
but that as a portrait painter he had yet to find himself.
These were the variations on the one familiar
theme; for as to his modernity, which was obvious,
they were all agreed. But at last he came across an
account of himself which he acknowledged to be more
or less consistent and correct. It was the final appreciation,
the summing up of a judge who was said to be
the only man in England who had a right to his opinion.
And this was his opinion of Maurice Durant:</p>

<p>"He stands in a unique and interesting position. On
his right hand, the hand he paints with, are the heights
unattainable by any but the great artists; on his left,
the dizzy verge of popularity. As a matter of fact, he
is neither popular nor great. His just horror of vulgarity
will save him from the abyss; his equal fear of
committing himself, of letting himself go, the fear,
shall I say, of failure, of the fantastic or ridiculous
attitudes a man necessarily assumes in falling from a
height, will keep him forever from the loftier way.
It is not that his temperament is naturally timorous
and cold; if he is afraid of anything, he is afraid of
his own rashness, his own heat. There are about him
delicacies and repugnances, a certain carefully cultivated
restraint, and a half-critical, half-imaginative
caution which, we submit, is incompatible with greatness
in his art. But he has imagination."</p>

<p>A little more praise or a little more blame, and he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
would have suspected himself of genius; as it was, he
was content to stand distinguished from the ruck of
the popular and the respectable by virtue of that
imagination which his critic had allowed to him. He
was not a great painter, and he knew it; but he was a
brilliantly clever one, and he knew that also, and in
the fact and his intimate knowledge of it lay the secret
of his success. He kept a cool head on his shoulders,
and thus his position and the personal dignity depending
on it were secure. He would never tumble from
his height through the giddiness of vanity; and when
the same high authority kept on assuring the world, on
the word of a critic, that Maurice Durant was branded
with the curse of cleverness, that he was the victim of
his own versatility, and that he had just missed greatness,
Maurice merely remarked that he was glad to
hear it, for he was sure that greatness would have bored
him.</p>

<p>Whether it was the same ungovernable terror that
restrained him from marrying, or whether he was the
friend of too many women to be the lover of one, or
whether he really was self-contained and self-sufficient,
all this time he had remained single. His singleness
had many advantages; it kept him free; it made it
easy for him to get about from place to place and
obtain an uninterrupted view of the world; it left an
open way for his abrupt incalculable movements, his
panic flights.</p>

<p>And as he had always fled from everything that disturbed
and irritated him, so now, in the very middle
of an English summer and a London season, he was
flying from the sound of his own fame. Not far this
time; only from the center to the verge, from Piccadilly
pavement to the south coast. He had hired a
small cutter for a month, and lived on board in much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
physical discomfort and intellectual peace. He hardly
knew it by sight, that beautiful full face of his own
country; but he was learning to know it as he sailed
from the white cliffs to the red, from the red to the
gray and black, the iron slopes and precipices of the
Land's End.</p>

<p>He had just returned from a fortnight's cruise, and
was wondering what he would do with the weeks that
remained to him&mdash;whether he would explore the west
coast of England or set sail for the Channel Islands&mdash;when
he found himself, very lazy and very happy, lying
at anchor in a certain white-walled harbor in the south
of Cornwall. A neighboring regatta had carried off,
the fleet of yachts that had their moorings there, and
the harbor was dotted with fishing-boats, pilot-boats,
ocean steamers, steam tugs, wherries, and such craft.
The little <i>Torch</i>, rocking madly on miniature waves
as she played with her chain, was almost alone in her
lightness and frivolity. About an hour before midnight
Durant woke in his berth, and felt this vivacity
of hers increasing; larger waves lapped her and broke
against her sides, but overhead, on deck, there was no
sign of a wind. He got up, climbed the companion
ladder, and put his head out over the hatch. A
schooner yacht had come in, and lay straining at her
cable in the narrow channel between the <i>Torch</i> and a
Portsmouth pilot. She had only just put into harbor,
for her crew were still busy taking down her sails. As
if it were her own movement alone that made her
visible, she swayed there, dimly discerned, while she
slipped her white canvas like a beauty disrobing in
the dark, sail by sail, till she stood naked under a veil
of dusk, and the light went up above her bows.</p>

<p>A restless thing that schooner yacht; her canvas was
hardly lowered before it was up again. She had not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
long lain dreaming, passive to the will of the tide. At
sunrise she awoke, and what with her own swinging
and vibration, and the voices and trampling of her joyous,
red-capped, blue-jerseyed crew, there was no sleep
for anyone in her neighborhood after three o'clock.
So Durant rolled out of his berth, dressed hastily, and
went on deck, eager to see her in her beauty, robed for
the morning and the wind. There she was, so near
now that he could almost have tipped a rope-end down
her skylight from the skylight of the <i>Torch</i>, every line
of her exquisite body new-washed in gold and shivering
under the touches of the dawn. She was awake,
alive; the life that had still beaten through her dreams
in the night, stirred by the drowsy fingering of the harbor
tide, was throbbing and thrilling with many pulses
as she shook out her streamers to the wind. And now
her mainsail went slowly up, and she leapt and shuddered
through all her being, passionate as though the
will of the wind was her will.</p>

<p>Durant stared at her with undisguised admiration.
She was a fair size for her kind, and from the sounds
that came up through her cabin skylight he judged that
she had a party on board. Standing on the deck of
the <i>Torch</i> in his light flannels, Durant looked much
too long for his own ridiculously tiny cutter. He was
so deeply absorbed in spelling out the letters on the
yacht's life-belts&mdash;<i>Windward</i>&mdash;that he was quite unaware
that he himself was an object of considerable
interest to a lady who had just come on deck. Literally
flying as he was from the sound of his own name,
he was unprepared to hear it sung out in cheerful
greeting.</p>

<p>"Mr. Durant!"</p>

<p>He started and blinked, unable to recognize the lady
of the voice. Assuming that he had once known, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
since forgotten her, he had raised his cap on the chance.</p>

<p>She was trying to say something to him now, but
the noise of the struggling sail cut off her words. She
turned, and seemed to be calling to somebody else.
Another lady, whom the sail had hidden from his sight
till now, came forward and leaned eagerly over the rail,
steadying herself by the shrouds. This lady did not
shout his name; but, as her eyes met his across the
narrow channel, she smiled&mdash;a smile he could not place
or recognize or understand; he could only raise his cap
to it blindly as before.</p>

<p>She was smiling still, while the first lady laughed,
if possible in a more bewildering manner than before.
"Don't you know us?" She seemed to be whispering
across the gulf.</p>

<p>He shook his head in desperation, whereupon the
second lady gave orders to the men to stop hoisting the
mainsail.</p>

<p>"If you <i>are</i> Mr. Durant, come on board!"</p>

<p>This time the voice was distinct in the silence that
followed the hoisting of the sail. He knew that lady
now.</p>

<p>And he knew the other also, though there was nothing
but the turn of her head and the black accent over
her eyes to remind him of Frida Tancred.</p>


<h3>XV</h3>

<p>"Well, is it all that you expected? Does the reality
come up to the dream?"</p>

<p>"It does. I never knew a dream that tallied so exactly
with the reality."</p>

<p>Frida was leaning back in a deck-chair, looking at
Durant, who sat beside her on the schooner's rail.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span></p>

<p>For three days the <i>Windward</i> had sailed up and
down the coast of Cornwall; for three days the little
<i>Torch</i>, with all sails set, wheeled round her moorings
or followed her flight. Durant had accepted Miss Tancred's
invitation to join them in a week's cruise in
English waters. He spent his mornings in his own
yacht, his afternoons and evenings on board the
schooner. The proposal had been a godsend to him in
his state of indecision. After his aimless wanderings
he was exhilarated by this eager challenge and pursuit,
absurdly pitting the speed of his own small craft
against the swiftness and strength of the larger vessel.
But he enjoyed still more sitting on the rail of the
<i>Windward</i> and talking to Frida. There was something
infinitely soothing in the society of a woman who knew
nothing and cared nothing about his fame. He was
not the only guest. Besides Miss Chatterton there was
Mr. Manby, a little middle-aged gentleman, who called
himself an artist; Miss Manby, a little middle-aged
woman, who seemed to be his sister; and two little
girls with their hair down their backs, his daughters,
Eileen and Ermyntrude Manby. Durant was a good
deal alone with Frida, for a stiff breeze had kept the
artist and his sister much below, and Georgie and the
little girls hardly counted.</p>

<p>They were alone now.</p>

<p>Frida had smiled as she spoke, a smile of intelligence
and reminiscence; and he was irresistibly reminded
of the first and last occasion when he had discoursed
to her about realities.</p>

<p>"And what are you going to do with it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"With what? With the reality or the dream?"</p>

<p>"With both, with life&mdash;now you've got it?"</p>

<p>"Why should I do anything with it? Unless you're
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
talking of moral obligations, which would be very tiresome
of you."</p>

<p>"I'm not thinking of moral obligations."</p>

<p>"What were you thinking of, then?"</p>

<p>"I was thinking&mdash;of you."</p>

<p>Frida lay back a little further on her cushion as if
she were withdrawing herself somewhat from his scrutiny.
She clasped her hands behind her head; her face
was uptilted to the sky.</p>

<p>His eyes followed her gaze. Over their heads the
wind had piled up a great palace of white clouds;
under the rifted floors the blue sky ran shallow in a
faint milky turquoise, while above, between, beyond
those aerial roofs and pinnacles and domes it deepened
to <i>lapis lazuli</i>, luminous, transparent, light behind color
and color behind light. The green earth looked
greener under the low-lying shafts of blue and silver;
far off, on the sea, the shadows of the clouds lay like
the stain of spilt red wine.</p>

<p>"Who was the great man?" she asked with apparent
irrelevance, "who said that women were incapable of
a disinterested passion for nature?"</p>

<p>He knitted his brows. Frida had proved a little disconcerting
at times. He had had to begin all over
again with her, aware that, though ostensibly renewing
their old acquaintance, he was actually making a new
one, to which faint recognitions and perishing reminiscences
gave a bewildering, elusive charm. But Frida
remembered many things that he had forgotten, and a
certain directness and familiarity born of this superior
memory of hers puzzled him and put him out. This
time, however, he had a dreamy recollection.</p>

<p>"Fancy your remembering that!"</p>

<p>"I remember everything. At any rate, I remember
quite enough to see that you're just the same; you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
haven't changed a little bit. Except that you don't
look as you did the first night I met you."</p>

<p>"And how did I look then?"</p>

<p>She paused, carefully selecting her phrase. "You
looked&mdash;as if&mdash;I'd given you a shock. You had expected
something different. That dream did <i>not</i> tally
with the reality."</p>

<p>"How on earth&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How on earth did I know? You may not be aware
of it, but you have a very expressive face."</p>

<p>"I was not aware of it."</p>

<p>Poor Durant. His face was expressive enough now
in all conscience. She held out her hand and laid it
on his sleeve, and he remembered how she used to
shrink from his touch.</p>

<p>"My dear Mr. Durant, don't look like that; it makes
my heart bleed. Of course I saw it. I saw everything.
I saw your face looking over the banisters as
I was going downstairs, when I've no doubt you
thought you'd caught sight of a very pretty woman;
and I saw it with a very different expression on it when
you shook hands and found that the woman wasn't a
bit pretty, after all. Of course it was a shock to you,
and of course I understood. I knew so exactly how
you felt, and I was so sincerely sorry for you."</p>

<p>"Sorry! I have a distinct recollection of being
abominably rude to you that night, and unpleasant
afterward. Can you, will you forgive me?"</p>

<p>"What? Five years after the offense? No. I forgave
you at the time; I'm not going to do it all over
again. What does it matter? It's all so long ago.
The funny part of it was that I wasn't a bit annoyed
with you, but I was furious with&mdash;whom do you
think?"</p>

<p>"I haven't a notion if it wasn't with me."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was a she&mdash;the other lady, the woman I wasn't,
the woman you thought I was, my ideal self. Needless
to say, my feminine jealousy was such that I could
have throttled her. I suppose I did pretty well do for
her as it happened. There can be nothing deader than
a dead idea."</p>

<p>"Don't be too sure. I have known them come to
life again."</p>

<p>His gaze, that had fallen, and was resting on the hem
of her blue serge gown, now traveled up the long,
slender line of her limbs, past the dim curves of her
body to the wonder of her face. How marvelously
changed she was! She was not only both younger and
older than when he had left her five years ago, she
was another woman. The heaviness had gone from
her eyes and forehead, the bitter, determined, self-restraint
from her mouth and chin; instead of self-restraint
she had acquired that rarer virtue, self-possession.
Her lips had softened, had blossomed into the
sweet red flower that was part of Nature's original
design. Her face had grown plastic to her feeling and
her thought. She was ripened and freshened by sun
and wind, by salt water and salt air; a certain nameless,
intangible grace that he had caught once, twice,
long ago, and seen no more, was now her abiding
charm. The haggard, sallow-faced provincial, with her
inscrutable manners and tumultuous heart, had developed
into the finished cosmopolitan; she had about
her the glory and bloom of the world. For once his
artist's instinct had failed him; he had not discovered
the promise of her physical beauty&mdash;but that he should
have ignored the finer possibilities of her soul! If
she had really known all that he had thought and felt
about her then, had understood and had yet forgiven
him, Frida was unlike any other woman in the world.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
He was not sure that this was not the secret of her
charm&mdash;the marvelous dexterity of her sympathy, the
swiftness with which she precipitated herself into his
point of view. It had its drawbacks; it meant that
she could see another man's and her own with equal
clearness.</p>

<p>The sound of voices from a neighboring cabin, followed
by the noise of unskillful footsteps stumbling
up a companion ladder, warned them that they were
not alone. Mr. Manby appeared on deck with great
noise and circumstance, skating, struggling, clutching
at impossible supports, being much hampered by a
camp stool and a sketching block which he carried, and
his own legs, which seemed hardly equal to carrying
him. Durant had recognized in the little artist a
familiar type. A small, nervous man, attired in the
usual threadbare gray trousers, the usual seedy velveteen
coat and slouch hat, with a great deal of grizzled
hair tumbling in the usual disorder about his peaked
and peevish face. Durant sprang forward and helped
this pitiful figure to find its legs; not with purely
benevolent intentions, he settled it and its belongings
in a secure (and remote) position amidships.</p>

<p>"Glad to see you back again!" Frida sang out.</p>

<p>Mr. Manby screwed up his eyes, put his head very
much on one side, and peered into the wild face of
Nature with a pale, propitiatory smile.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; I mustn't neglect my opportunities.
Every minute of this weather is invaluable."</p>

<p>"It strikes me," said Frida, as Durant established
himself beside her again, "that it's you artists whose
devotion to Nature is&mdash;well&mdash;not altogether disinterested."</p>

<p>"Manby's affection seems to be pretty sincere; it
stands the test of seasickness."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Manby doesn't really care very much for
nature or for art either."</p>

<p>"What does he try to paint pictures for, then?"</p>

<p>"He tries to paint them for a living, for himself and
the little girls." And Frida looked tenderly at Mr.
Manby as she spoke.</p>

<p>At that moment Durant hated Mr. Manby with a
deadly hatred. He had gone so far as to find a malignant
satisfaction in the thought that Mr. Manby's
pictures were bad, when he remembered that Frida had
a weakness for bad pictures. Art did not appeal to
Frida. She talked about Paris and Florence and Rome
without a word of the Louvre or the Uffizi Gallery or
the Vatican. She didn't care a rap about Raphael or
Rubens, but she hampered herself with Manbys.</p>

<p>"Is there a Mrs. Manby?" he asked gloomily.</p>

<p>"No. Mrs. Manby died last year."</p>

<p>"H'mph! Poor devil! Lucky for her, though."</p>

<p>Frida ignored the implication. "To go back to the
point we were discussing. If you were honest you'd
own that you only care for nature because you can
make pictures out of it. Now I, on the contrary, have
no ulterior motives; I don't want to make anything
out of it."</p>

<p>"I wasn't talking about nature. I want to know
what you are going to make of your life."</p>

<p>"There you are again. Why should I make anything
of it? You talk as if life were so much raw material
to be worked into something that it isn't. To my mind
it's beautiful enough as it is. I should spoil it if I
tried to make anything of it."</p>

<p>He looked at her and he understood. He was a man
of talent, some said of genius, but in her there was
something greater than that; it was the genius of temperament,
an infinite capacity for taking pleasures.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
To her life was more than mere raw material, it came
finished to her hands, because it had lived a long life
in her soul. Her dream had tallied.</p>

<p>Beside that rich creative impulse, that divine imagination
of hers, his own appeared as something imitative
and secondhand, and his art essentially degraded. He
was nothing better than a copyist, the plagiarist of
nature.</p>

<p>He looked up to where Mr. Manby sat smiling over
his sketching block, Mr. Manby, surrounded by his admiring
family. Mr. Manby did not see them; he was
wrapped in his dream, absorbed in his talent with all
its innocent enormities. He at any rate had no misgivings.
The little girls, Eileen and Ermyntrude,
played about him; they played with blocks and life-buoys
and cables, they jumped over coils of rope, they
spun round to leeward till the wind wound their faces
in their long hair, they ran for'ard, shrieking with
happy laughter as they were caught by the showers of
spray flung from the yacht's bows. Frida's eyes followed
them, and Durant's eyes followed Frida's.</p>

<p>"They are seeing the world, too, it seems."</p>

<p>"Yes; they have caught the fever. But they are
young, as you see; they have taken it in time. Some
day they'll be tired of wandering, and they'll settle
down in a house of their own, over here in England,
and be dear little wives and mothers."</p>

<p>"Eileen and Ermyntrude&mdash;by the way, I never know
which is Eileen and which is Ermyntrude. And you,
will you never be tired of wandering?"</p>

<p>She looked at him with the lucid, penetrating gaze
he knew so well. "Never. I took the fever when I
was&mdash;not young, and it goes harder with you then.
There's no hope for me; I shall never be cured."</p>

<p>She rose and joined the Manbys. The little girls ran
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
to meet her, they clung to her skirts and danced round
her; she put her arm round Ermyntrude, the younger,
and Durant saw her winding her long fingers in and
out of the golden hair, and looking down into the
child's face, Madonna-like, with humid, tender, maternal
eyes.</p>

<p>He thought of her as the mother of Manby's children,
and he hated the little girls.</p>

<p>There was a voice at his elbow. "Isn't she splendid?"
Miss Chatterton had seated herself in Frida's
chair.</p>

<p>Her presence brought him instantaneous relief. He
had been glad to meet Miss Chatterton again. Not
that he would have known her, for time had not dealt
very kindly with the young girl. Her face, from overmuch
play of expression, showed a few little wrinkles
already, her complexion had suffered the fate of sanguine
complexions, it had not gone altogether, but it
was going&mdash;fast, the color was beginning to run. But
time had not subdued her extravagant spirits or
touched her imperishable mirth. In spite of a lapse
of five years she gave him a pleasant sense of continuity;
she took him up exactly where she had put him
down, on the platform of the little wayside station of
Whithorn-in-Arden. Unlike Frida, Miss Chatterton
had not developed. When she began to talk she had
the air of merely continuing their last important conversation.</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you how she'd come out if she got her
chance?"</p>

<p>"You did."</p>

<p>"And wasn't I right?"</p>

<p>"You were."</p>

<p>"But you oughtn't to have needed telling, you ought
to have seen it for yourself."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span></p>

<p>"Right again. I ought to have seen it for myself."</p>

<p>"He who will not when he may will live to fight another
day; isn't that how it goes on?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I congratulate you on your work."</p>

<p>"It isn't my work, lord bless you! nor yours, either&mdash;<i>there</i>
I was wrong."</p>

<p>"What is it, then?"</p>

<p>Miss Chatterton stared out over the sea and into the
universal air. "Why, it's&mdash;it's everything! Of course
you did something, so did I. But if it comes to that,
the present Mrs. Tancred did more than either of us.
We couldn't have married the Colonel."</p>

<p>"Then you think that was the reason why she&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I do, indeed. She could have had no other. You
see she was awfully fond of Frida. And, what's more,
she was fond of you."</p>

<p>It was his turn to look out over the sea.</p>

<p>"What do you think? He has never forgiven her for
going away, though it happened to be the very thing
he wanted. How's that for inconsistency?"</p>

<p>"Has she seen the&mdash;the Colonel since?"</p>

<p>"She has. A strange, unaccountable longing to see
the Colonel comes over her periodically, like a madness,
and she rushes home from the ends of the earth.
That's happened three times. It's the most erratic
and incalculable thing about her. But going home
doesn't answer."</p>

<p>"I should hardly have thought it would."</p>

<p>"Except that she's got the control of more money
now. Tell you how it happened. The last time she
went home she found the poor little Colonel making
his little will. He asked her point-blank what she
meant to do with the property when he was in his
little grave. He must have had an inkling. And
Frida, who is honesty itself, said she didn't know, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
she rather thought she would sell it and make for the
unexplored. Then he was frightened, and made her
make a solemn vow never to do anything of the kind.
Somehow the property seems to have recovered itself,
with all she put into it; anyhow, after that, it managed
to disgorge another thousand a year. So Frida's
more independent than ever."</p>

<p>Durant made an impatient movement that nearly
sent him overboard to the bottom of the sea, where,
indeed, he wished that Frida Tancred's thousands were
lying. Georgie noticed the movement, and blushed for
the first time in their acquaintance.</p>

<p>"Just look at those children," said she, "they simply
adore Frida. It's odd, but she's got the most curious
power of making people adore her. I don't know what
she does to them, but waiters, policemen, porters, customhouse
officers, they're all the same. The people in
the hotels we stayed in adored her. So did the Arabs
up the Nile and the Soudanese in the desert, so did the
Kaffirs on the veldt and the coolies that carried her up
the Himalayas&mdash;and she's no light weight, is Frida."</p>

<p>Georgie paused while her fancy followed Frida in
delightful retrospect. Durant said nothing, he sat
waiting for her to go on. She went on.</p>

<p>"Women, too&mdash;I've seen them hanging about drafty
corridors for hours on the off chance of seeing her.
There was a dreadful girl we knew in Paris, who used
to grovel on her doormat and weep because she said
Frida wouldn't speak to her. Frida loathed her, but
she was awfully nice to her till one day when she
tripped over her on the mat. Then she wasn't nice to
her at all; she hauled her up by the belt, and told her
to get up and go away and never make such a fool of
herself again."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span></p>

<p>Georgie cast at Durant a look that said, "That's
how our Frida deals with obstructives!"</p>

<p>"And where was all this remarkable fascination five
years ago?"</p>

<p>"It was there all right enough, lying dormant, you
know. I felt it. Mrs. Fazakerly felt it&mdash;that's why
she married the Colonel. You felt it."</p>

<p>"I didn't."</p>

<p>"Excuse me, you did. That's why you stayed three
weeks at Coton Manor when you needn't have stopped
three days. As for Mr. Manby there, he simply worships
the ground she treads on, as they say."</p>

<p>"The devil he does! What's he doing here?"</p>

<p>"As you see, he's painting pictures as hard as ever
he can go. He paints them in order to live; but as he
has to live in order to paint, Frida&mdash;well, between you
and me, Frida keeps him and Eileen and Ermyntrude,
the whole family, in short. But that's a detail. It
isn't offered as any explanation of the charm. I don't
believe that anybody ever realizes that Frida has
money."</p>

<p>He could believe that. He had never realized it himself.
Her enjoyment of life was so finished an art that
it kept its machinery well out of sight.</p>

<p>"Frida," Georgie serenely continued, "has a weakness
for landscape painters. The memory of her mother&mdash;no
doubt."</p>

<p>"Don't they&mdash;don't they bore her?"</p>

<p>"No. It takes a great deal to bore Frida&mdash;naturally,
after the Colonel. Besides, she doesn't give them the
chance. Nobody ever gets what you may call a hold
on Frida. There's so much more of her than they can
grasp. And there are, at least, three sides of her by
which she's unapproachable. One of them's her liberty.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
If you or I or the little Manby man were to take
liberties with her liberty Frida would&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What would Frida do?"</p>

<p>"She would drop us down, very gently, at the nearest
port, and make for the Unexplored! And yet, I don't
know. That's the lovely and fascinating thing about
Frida&mdash;that you never <i>do</i> know."</p>


<h3>XVI</h3>

<p>The fortnight's cruise was at an end, the <i>Torch</i> had
gone back to her owners, without Durant, who had
contrived to stay on board the <i>Windward</i> till the latest
possible moment. The yacht was lying-to, outside the
same white-walled harbor where she had first found
Durant. She wheeled aimlessly about with slackened
sails, swaying, balancing, hovering like a bird on the
wing, impervious and restless, waiting for the return
of the boat that was to take Durant on shore. It had
only just put off with the first load of guests&mdash;the
Manbys&mdash;under Georgie Chatterton's escort. As
Durant watched it diminishing and vanishing, he
thought of how Georgie had described their hostess's
method of dealing with exacting friends. She was
dropping them, very gently, at the nearest port. Poor
Manby! And it would be his own turn next. And
yet Georgie had said, "You never know." He must
and would know; at any rate, he would take his chance.
Meanwhile, he had a whole hour before him to find out
in, for the crew had commissions in the town. That
hour was Frida's and his own.</p>

<p>The two weeks had gone he knew not how; and yet
he had taken count of the procession of the days.
Days of clouds, when, under a drenching mist, the land
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
was sodden into the likeness of the sea, the sea stilled
into a leaden image of the land; days of rain, when
the wet decks shone like amber, and the sea's face was
smoothed out and pitted by the showers; days of sun,
when they went with every sail spread, over a warm,
quivering sea, whose ripples bore the shivered reflections
of the sky in so many blue flames that leaped
and danced with the <i>Windward</i> in her course; days of
wind, when the Channel was a race of tumultuous
waves, green-hearted, silver-lipped, swelling and breaking
and swelling, and flowering into foam, days when
the yacht careened over with steep decks, laid between
wind and water, flush with the foam, driven by the
wind as by her soul; days when Durant and Frida, who
delighted in rough weather, sat out together on deck
alone. They knew every sound of that marvelous
world, sounds of the calm, of water lapping against the
yacht's side, the tender, half-audible caress of the sea;
sounds of the coming gale, more seen than heard, more
felt than seen, the deep, long-drawn shudder of the sea
when the wind's path is as the rain's path; and that
sound, the song of her soul, the keen, high, exultant
song that the wind sings, playing on her shrouds as on
a many-stringed instrument. The boat, in her unrest,
rolling, tossing, wheeling and flying, was herself so
alive, so one with the moving wind and water, and
withal so slight a shell for the humanity within her,
that she had brought them, the man and the woman,
nearer and nearer to the heart of being; they touched
through her the deep elemental forces of the world.
The sea had joined what the land had kept asunder.
At this last hour of Durant's last day they were drifting
rather than sailing past a sunken shore, a fringe
of gray slate, battered by the tide and broken into thin
layers, with edges keen as knives; above it, low woods
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
of dwarf oaks stretched northward, gray and phantasmal
as the shore, stunted and tortured into writhing,
unearthly shapes by the violence of storms. For here
and now the sea had its way; it had taken on reality;
and earth was the phantom, the vanishing, the vague.</p>

<p>They had been pacing the deck together for some
minutes, but at last they stood still, looking landward.</p>

<p>Durant sighed heavily and then he spoke.</p>

<p>"Frida, you know what I am going to say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>They turned and faced each other. In the man's
eyes there was a cloud, in the woman's a light, a light
of wonder and of terror.</p>

<p>She smiled bravely through her fear. "Yes, I know
what you are going to say. But I don't know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What <i>don't</i> you know?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean."</p>

<p>"You don't know what I mean?"</p>

<p>"I know you are going to say you love me, and you
had better not. For I don't know what that means.
The thing you call love was left out of my composition.
Some women are born like that."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it. It's only your way of saying that
you don't care for <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>"I like you. I always have liked you. I'll go farther&mdash;if
I ever loved any man it would be you."</p>

<p>"The fact remains that it isn't?"</p>

<p>"It isn't, and it never will be. But you may be very
certain that it will never be anyone else."</p>

<p>"Tell me one thing&mdash;was there ever a time when it
might have been?"</p>

<p>"That isn't fair. I can't answer that question."</p>

<p>"You can. Think&mdash;was there ever a time, no matter
how short, the fraction of a minute, when if I'd only
had the sense, if I had only known&mdash;&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you sure you didn't know? I was afraid you
did."</p>

<p>"Then you really mean it&mdash;that if I'd only asked
you then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven, you did not!"</p>

<p>"Why are you thanking Heaven?"</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;because&mdash;I can't be sure, but I might&mdash;I
might have taken you at your word."</p>

<p>"And why not?"</p>

<p>"I would have made a great mistake. The same mistake
that you are making now."</p>

<p>"Mistake?"</p>

<p>"You mistook the idea for the reality once, if you
remember&mdash;and now aren't you mistaking the reality
for the idea?"</p>

<p>"Frida, you are too subtle; you are the most exasperating
woman in the world&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There, you see. That's the sort of thing we should
always be saying to each other if I let you have your
way. But supposing you did have it; if we were married
we could not understand each other better than
we do; so we should not be one bit better off. By this
time we should have got beyond the phase we started
with&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But we should have <i>had</i> it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes; and found ourselves precisely where we are
now."</p>

<p>"Where we were yesterday, you mean."</p>

<p>"Yes. We were good enough friends yesterday."</p>

<p>"And what are we to-day? Enemies?"</p>

<p>She smiled sadly. "It looks like it. At any rate, we
seem to have some difficulty in understanding each
other."</p>

<p>"Good God! how coolly you talk about it! Understanding!
Do you never feel? Has it never even occurred

to you that I can feel? Have you any notion
what it is to be made of flesh and blood and nerves,
and to have to stay here, squeezed up in this confounded
boat, where I can't get away from you?"</p>

<p>"You can get away in three-quarters of an hour, and
meanwhile, if you like, you can go below."</p>

<p>"If I did go below I should still feel you walking over
my head. I should hear you breathe. And now to look
at you and touch you, and know all the time that something
sticks between us&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped and looked before him. It was true that
the sea had brought them together. Amid the d&aelig;monic
triumph and jubilation of the power that claimed them
for its own they, the man and the woman, had been
thrown on each other, they had looked into each other's
eyes, spirit to spirit, the divine thing struggling blind
and uncertain in nature's tangled mesh. But now, so
near, on the verge of the intangible, the divine, it came
over Durant that after all it was this their common
nature, their flesh and blood, that was the barrier; it
merged them with the world on every side, but it
hedged them in and hid them from each other.</p>

<p>"As you know, we're the best friends in the world;
there's only one thing that sticks between us&mdash;the
eternal difference in our points of view."</p>

<p>"I was perfectly right. Why couldn't I trust my
first impressions? I thought you frigid and lucid and
inhuman&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Inhuman?"</p>

<p>"Well, not a bit like a woman."</p>

<p>"My dear Maurice, you are very like a man."</p>

<p>"There's something about you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Really? What is it, do you think?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing; a slight defect, that's all. It must be
as you say, and as I always thought, that you are incapable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
of feeling or understanding feeling. I repeat,
there's something about you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, Maurice, if you want the truth, there's something
about <i>you</i>. I always knew, I felt that it was in
you, though I wouldn't own that it was there. Now I
am sure. You've been doing your best to make me
sure."</p>

<p>"What have I made you sure of?"</p>

<p>"Sure that you are incapable, not of loving perhaps,
but of loving a certain kind of woman the way she
wants to be loved. You can't help it. As I said before,
it is the difference in the point of view. We should get
no nearer if we talked till doomsday."</p>

<p>"My point of view, as you call it, has entirely
changed."</p>

<p>"No. It is I who have changed. Your point of view
is, and always will be, the same."</p>

<p>He tried hard to understand.</p>

<p>"Does it come to this&mdash;that if I had loved you then
you would have loved me now?"</p>

<p>"You couldn't have loved me then. You were not
that sort."</p>

<p>He understood her meaning and it maddened him.
"It wasn't my fault. How the devil was I to see?"</p>

<p>"Exactly, how were you? There are some things
which you can't see. You can see everything you can
paint, and, as you are a very clever artist, I dare say
you can paint most things you can see."</p>

<p>"What has that got to do with it?"</p>

<p>"Everything. It's your way all through. You love
me because what you see of me is changed. And yet all
that time I was the same woman I am now. I am the
same woman I was then."</p>

<p>"But I am not the same man!"</p>

<p>"The very same. You have not changed at all."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span></p>

<p>She meant that he was deficient in that spiritual
imagination which was her special power; she meant
that she had perceived the implicit baseness of his
earlier attitude as a man to her as a woman, a woman
who had had no power to touch his senses. It was, as
she had said, the difference in their points of view;
hers had condemned him forever to the sensual and the
seen.</p>

<p>He stood ashamed before her.</p>

<p>Yet, as if she had divined his shame and measured
the anguish of it and repented her, she laid her hand
on his arm.</p>

<p>"Maurice, it isn't entirely so. I have been horribly
unjust."</p>

<p>"Not you! You are justice incarnate. If I had
loved you then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You couldn't have loved me then."</p>

<p>"So you have just told me."</p>

<p>"You had good cause. I was not and could not be
then&mdash;whatever it is that you love now."</p>

<p>"But I might have seen&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Seen? Seen? That's it. There was nothing to
see."</p>

<p>Her eyes, in her pity for him, filled with tears, tears
that in his anger he could not understand.</p>

<p>"Why are you always reminding me of what I was
five years ago? I <i>have</i> changed. Can't a man change
if you give him five years to do it in?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps. It's a long time."</p>

<p>"Time? It's an eternity. If I was a brute to you,
do you suppose the consciousness of my brutality isn't
a far worse punishment than anything I could have
made you feel?"</p>

<p>She raised her eyebrows. "What? Have you been
suffering all this time&mdash;this eternity?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes. That is, I'm suffering enough now."</p>

<p>"Then perhaps you have some idea of what you made
me feel."</p>

<p>"Again?"</p>

<p>"It's the first time I've reproached you with it, even
in my thoughts."</p>

<p>He looked at her with unbelieving eyes. And yet he
knew that it was true. Her sweetness, her lucidity,
had been proof against the supreme provocation. She
had forgiven, if she had not forgotten, the insult that
no woman remembers and forgives.</p>

<p>As his eyes wandered the hand that had lain so
lightly on his arm gripped it to command his attention,
and he trembled through all his being. But she no
longer shrank from him; she kept her hold, she tightened
it, insisting.</p>

<p>"Oh, Maurice! haven't I told you that I understood?"</p>

<p>He smiled. "Yes. Thank God I can always appeal
to your understanding, if I can't get at your heart.
Supposing I didn't care for you then? Supposing I
was too stupid to see what you were? Is five years,
though it may be eternity, so long a time to learn to
know you in? You take a great deal of learning, Frida;
you are very difficult. There's so much more of you
than any man can grasp. But you are the only woman
I ever cared to know. I believe you have a thousand
sides to you, and every one&mdash;every one I can see&mdash;appeals
to me. There's no end to the interest. Whatever
I see or don't see, I always find something more,
and I never could be tired of looking."</p>

<p>She sighed and was silent.</p>

<p>"And you blame me because I couldn't see all this
at once? Because it took me five years to love you?
Remember, you were very cautious; you wouldn't let
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
me see more than a bit at a time. But I love every
bit of you&mdash;heart and soul, and body and brain; I love
you as I never could love any other woman in the
world&mdash;the world, Frida," he added, pointing the hackneyed
phrase. "You <i>are</i> the world."</p>

<p>They had never stopped pacing the deck together,
as they talked, turn after turn, alike and yet unlike
in their eagerness and unrest. Now they stood still.
Far off they could see the returning boat, a speck at
the mouth of the harbor, and they knew that their time
was short.</p>

<p>"Maurice," she said, "before you go I have a confession
to make. I wasn't quite honest with you just
now when I said I only liked you five years ago. I
know very well that I loved you. The world has taught
me so much."</p>

<p>The world! He frowned angrily as she said it. But
through all his anger he admired the reckless nobility
of soul that had urged her to that last admission, by
way of softening the pangs and penalties she dealt to
him. Would any other woman have confessed as much
to the man who had once despised her, and now found
himself in her power?</p>

<p>She went on. "I thought you might like to know it.
I've gone far enough, perhaps; but I'll go farther still.
I believe I would give the world to be able to love you
now."</p>

<p>"Frida, if you can go as far as that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can go no farther. No, Maurice, not one step."</p>

<p>"You can. I believe, even now, I could make you
love me."</p>

<p>"No. You see, women in my position, my unfortunate
position, want to be loved for themselves."</p>

<p>"I do love you for yourself. Do you doubt that,
too?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do not doubt it. I am quite sure of it. That's
where it is. I know you love me for myself, and so
many men have loved me&mdash;not for myself. Do you
suppose that doesn't touch me? If anything could
make me love you that would. And since it
doesn't&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The inference was obvious.</p>

<p>"Is it because you can't give up your life?"</p>

<p>"It is&mdash;partly. And yet I might do that. I did it
once."</p>

<p>"You did, indeed. I can't conceive how you, being
you, lived the life you did&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I owed it. It was the price of my freedom."</p>

<p>Her freedom! No wonder that she valued it, if she
had paid that price!</p>

<p>She went on dreamily, as if speaking more to herself
than him. "To have power over your life&mdash;to do what
you like with it&mdash;take it up or throw it down, to fling
it away if that seems the best thing to do. You're not
fit to take up your life if you haven't the strength to
put it down, too."</p>

<p>"Frida, if you were my wife you wouldn't have to
put it down. I'm not asking you to give up the world
for me; I'm not even asking you to give up one day
of your life. Your life would be exactly what it is now&mdash;plus
one thing. You'll say, 'What can I give you
that you haven't got?' I can give you what you've
never had. You don't know what a man's love is and
can be; and you must own that without that knowledge
your experience, even as experience, is not quite
as complete as it might be."</p>

<p>The boat&mdash;the boat that was to take him to the shore&mdash;was
getting nearer. It was his last chance. And
while he staked everything on that chance, he thought
of Frida as he had first seen her, as she sat tragically
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
at the whist table at Coton Manor, dealing out the
cards with deft and supple fingers.</p>

<p>Now she was dealing out his fate.</p>

<p>He remembered how she had said, "Mr. Durant wins
because he doesn't care about the game." Because he
cared&mdash;cared so supremely&mdash;was he going to lose?</p>

<p>There were so many things in Frida that he had not
reckoned with. She was an extraordinary mixture of
impulse and reserve, and she had astonished him more
than once by her readiness to give herself away; but
beyond a certain point&mdash;the point of view in fact&mdash;her
self-possession was complete. Still, he left no argument
untried, for there was no knowing&mdash;no knowing
what undiscovered spring he might chance to touch in
that rich and subtle nature.</p>

<p>Her self-possession was absolute. She parried his
probe with a thrust.</p>

<p>"It is your own fault if my experience isn't complete.
You should have told me these things five years ago.
As you say, nobody else has instructed me since."</p>

<p>"I dare say they've done their best. Of course, other
men have loved you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They haven't&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I believe my love would be worth more to you
than theirs, for the simple reason that I understand
you too well to insist on it. I should always know
how much and how little you wanted. For we are
rather alike in some ways. I would leave you free."</p>

<p>"I know you would. I am sure. And I would&mdash;I
would so gladly&mdash;but I can't! You see, Maurice, I
<i>have</i> loved you."</p>

<p>"All the more reason&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All the less. I knew what you thought and felt
about me, and it made no difference; I loved you just
the same, because I understood. Then I had to fight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
it. It was hard work, but I did it very thoroughly. It
will never have to be done again. Do you see?"</p>

<p>Yes; he saw very plainly. If Frida could not love
him there was nobody but himself to blame. He also
saw the advantage she had given him. She had owned
that she had loved him, and he had hardly realized the
full force of the pluperfect. What had been might be
again. She was a woman in whom the primordial
passion, once awakened, is eternal.</p>

<p>He pressed his advantage home.</p>

<p>"And why had you to fight so hard?"</p>

<p>"Because the thing was stronger than myself, and I
wouldn't be beaten. Because I hated myself for caring
for you, as I hate myself now for not caring."</p>

<p>In her blind pity she laid her fingers on his trembling
hand. She who used to drop his hand as if it had been
flame, she should have known better than to touch
him now.</p>

<p>He looked at her with hot hungry eyes. His brain
in its feverish intensity took note of trifles&mdash;the tortuous
pattern of the braid on her gown, the gold sleeve-links
at her wrists, the specks of brine that glistened
on her temples under the wind-woven strands of her
black hair; it recorded these things and remembered
them afterward. And all the time the boat came
nearer, and the slow, steady stroke of the oars measured
his hour by minutes, till the sweat, sprung from the
labor and passion of his nerves, stood out in beads on
his forehead.</p>

<p>He looked at her; and her beauty, the beauty born
of her freedom and abounding life, the beauty he worshiped,
was implacable; the divinity in it remained
untouched by his desire.</p>

<p>"You needn't care," he said desperately. "I'm not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
asking you to care; I'm not asking you to give me your
love, but only to take mine."</p>

<p>She smiled. "I'm not so dishonest as to borrow
what I can't repay."</p>

<p>His voice was monotonous in its iteration. "I'm not
talking about repayment; I'll risk that. I don't want
you to borrow it. I want you to take it, keep it, spend
it any way you like, and&mdash;throw it away when you can't
do anything more with it."</p>

<p>"And never return it? Ah, my friend! we can't do
these things."</p>

<p>She dropped into the deck-chair, exhausted with the
discussion. Her brow was heavy with thought; she
was still racking her brains to find some argument that
would appease him.</p>

<p>"I loved you&mdash;yes. And in my own way I love you
now, if you could only be content with my way."</p>

<p>"Haven't you told me that your way is not my
way?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and I've done worse than that. I've been
talking to you as if you had made me suffer tortures,
as if you had brought me all the pain of existence instead
of all the pleasure. If you only knew! There's
nothing I've been enjoying all these five years that
I don't owe to you&mdash;to you and nobody else. You
were very good to me even at the first; and afterward&mdash;well,
I believe I love life as few women can love it,
and it came to me through you. Do you think I can
ever forget that? Forget what I owe you? You stood
by me and showed me the way out; you stood by and
opened the door of the world."</p>

<p>To stand by and open the door for her&mdash;it was all
he was good for. In other words, she had made use of
him. Well, had he not proposed to make use of her?
After all, in what did his view of her differ from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
Colonel's, which he abominated? All along, from the
very first, it had been the old theory of the woman for
the man. Frida for the Colonel's use, for his (Durant's)
amusement, and now for his possession. Under
all its disguises it was only an exalted form of the
tyranny of sex. And Frida was making him see that
there was another way of looking at it&mdash;that a woman,
like nature, like life, may be an end in herself, to be
loved for herself, not for what he could make out of
her.</p>

<p>"I am a woman of the world, a worldly woman, if
you like. I love the world better than anyone in it.
And I'm a sort of pantheist, I suppose; I worship the
world. But you will always be a part of the world I
love and worship; I could not keep you out of it if I
would."</p>

<p>The exultation in her tone provoked his laughter.
"Heaven bless you&mdash;that's only a nice way of saying
that I'm done for.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'He is made one with Nature; there is heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His voice in all her music, from the moan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of thunder to the song of night's sweet bird.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>You <i>have</i> made a clean sweep of me and my personal
immortality."</p>

<p>The splash of the oars sounded nearer. They could
hear the voices of the crew; the boat, lightened of her
first load, was returning with horrible rapidity, it came
dancing toward them in its malignant glee; and they
sat facing each other for the last time, tongue-tied.</p>

<p>They had paced the deck together again; one more
turn for the last time.</p>

<p>Durant was silent. Her confession was still ringing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
in his ears; but it rang confusedly, it left his reason as
unconvinced as his heart was unsatisfied.</p>

<p>She <i>had</i> loved him, and not in her way, as she called
it, but in his. And that was a mystery. He felt that
if he could account for it he would have grasped the
clue, the key of the position. Whatever she might say,
these things were more than subtleties of the pure
reason, they were matters of the heart. He was still
building a hope beyond the ruins of hope.</p>

<p>"Frida," he said at last, "you are a wonderful woman,
so I can believe that you loved me. But, seeing what
I was and what you knew about me, I wonder why?"</p>

<p>Louder and nearer they heard the stroke of the oars
measuring the minutes. Frida's eyes were fixed on the
boat as she answered.</p>

<p>"Why? Ah, Maurice, how many times have I asked
myself that question? Why does any woman love any
man? As far as I can see, in nine hundred cases out
of a thousand woman is unhappy because she loves. In
the thousandth case she loves because she is unhappy."</p>

<p>The boat had arrived. The oars knocked against
the yacht's side with a light shock. Durant's hour was
at an end.</p>

<p>Frida held out her hand. He hardly touched it,
hardly raised his eyes to her as she said "Good-bye."
But on the last step of the gangway he turned and
looked at her&mdash;the woman in a thousand.</p>

<p>She was not unhappy.</p>


<h3>XVII</h3>

<p>Frida had played high and yet she had won the game
of life; that dangerous game which most women playing
single-handed are bound to lose. She had won,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
but whether by apathy or care, by skill or divine
chance, he could not tell. As to himself he was very
certain; when he might have won her he did not care to
win, now that he had lost her he would always care.
That was just his way.</p>

<p>Alone in the little hotel that looked over the harbor,
left to the tyrannous company of his own thoughts, he
made a desperate effort to understand her, to accept
her point of view, to be, as she was, comprehensive and
generous and just.</p>

<p>He believed every word she had ever said to him,
for she was truth itself; he believed her when she said
that she had loved him, that she loved him still. Of
course she loved him; but how?</p>

<p>They say that passion in a pure woman is first lit
at the light of the ideal, and burns downward from
spirit to earth. But Frida's had shot up full-flamed
from the dark, kindled at the hot heart of nature,
thence it had taken to itself wings and flown to the
ideal; and for its insatiable longing there was no ideal
but the whole. Other women before Frida had loved
the world too well; but for them the world meant
nothing but their own part and place in it. For Frida
it meant nothing short of the divine cosmos. Impossible
to fix her part and place in it; the woman was so
merged with the object of her desire. He, Maurice
Durant, was as she had said a part of that world, but
he was not the whole; he was not even the half, that
half which for most women is more than the whole.
From the first he had been to her the symbol of a
reality greater than himself; she loved not him, but
the world in him. And thus her love, like his own art,
had missed the touch of greatness. It was neither the
joy nor the tragedy of her life, but its one illuminating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
episode; or, rather, it was the lyrical prologue to the
grand drama of existence.</p>

<p>He did her justice. It was not that she was changeable
or capricious, or that her love was weak; on the
contrary, its very nature was to grow out of all bounds
of sex and mood and circumstance. Its progress had
been from Maurice Durant outward; from Maurice, as
the innermost kernel and heart of the world, to the
dim verge, the uttermost margin of the world; and that
by a million radiating paths. It was not that she left
Maurice behind her, for all those million paths led
back to him, the man was the center of her universe;
but then the center is infinitely small compared with
the circumference. He saw himself diminished to a
mathematical point in this cosmopolitan's cosmos.
For Frida he had ceased to have any objective existence,
he was an intellectual quantity, what the Colonel
would have called an abstraction. There was nothing
for him to do but to accept the transcendent position.</p>

<p>Thus, through all the tension of his soul, his intellect
still struggled for comprehension.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, from his window looking over the white-walled
harbor, he could see the <i>Windward</i> with all her
sails spread, outward bound.</p>

<p>He watched her till there was nothing to be seen but
her flying sails, till the sails were one white wing on a
dim violet sea, till the white wing was a gray dot, indistinct
on the margin of the world.</p>


<h3>XVIII</h3>

<p>He cared immensely. But not to come behind her
in generosity and comprehension he owned that he had
no right to complain because this remarkable woman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
loved the world better than one man, even if that man
happened to be himself; in fact, while his heart revolted
against it, his pure intellect admired her attitude,
for the world is a greater thing that any man
in it.</p>

<p>Now and again letters reached him across seas and
continents, letters with strange, outlandish postmarks,
wonderful, graphic, triumphant letters, which showed
him plainly, though unintentionally, that Frida Tancred
was still on the winning side, that she could do
without him. Across seas and continents he watched
her career with a sad and cynical sympathy, as a man
naturally watches a woman who triumphs where he
has failed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he lived on her letters, long and expansive,
or short and to the point. They proved a stimulating
diet; they had so much of her full-blooded
personality in them. His own grew shorter and shorter
and more and more to the point, till at last he wrote:
"Delightful. Only tell me when you've had enough
of it."</p>

<p>The answer to that came bounding, as it were, from
the other side of the Atlantic. "Not yet. I shall never
have enough of it. I've only been 'seeing the world,'
only traveling from point to point along an infinite
surface, and there's no satisfaction in that. I'm not
tired&mdash;not tired, Maurice, remember. I don't want
to stop. I want to strike down&mdash;deeper. It doesn't
matter what point you take, so long as you strike
down. Just at present I'm off for India."</p>

<p>Her postscript said: "If you ever hear of me doing
queer things, remember they were all in the day's
pleasure or the day's work."</p>

<p>He remembered&mdash;that Frida was only thirty-five;
which was young for Frida. And he said to himself,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
"It is all very well now, but what will she be in another
three years? I will give her another three years. By
that time she will be tired of the world, or the world
will be tired of her, which comes to the same thing, and
her heart (for she has a heart) will find her out. With
Frida you never know. I will wait and see."</p>

<p>He waited. The three years passed; he saw nothing
and he had ceased to hear. He concluded that Frida
still loved the world.</p>

<p>As if in a passionate resentment against the rival
that had fascinated and won her, he had left off wandering
and had buried himself in an obscure Cornish
village, where he gave himself up to his work. He was
not quite so successful as he had been; on the other
hand, he cared less than ever about success. It was
the end of the century, a century that had been forced
by the contemplation of such realities as plague and
famine, and war and rumors of war, to forego and forget
the melancholy art of its decadence. And from
other causes Durant had fallen into a state of extreme
dissatisfaction with himself. Five years ago he had
found himself, as they said; found himself out, <i>he</i> said,
when at the age of thirty-three he condemned himself
and his art as more decadent than the decadents. Frida
Tancred had shown insight when she reproached him
with his inability to see anything that he could not
paint, or to paint anything that he could not see. She
had shown him the vanity of the sensuous aspect, she
had forced him to love the intangible, the unseen, till
he had almost come to believe that it was all he loved.
The woman lived for him in her divine form, as his
imagination had first seen her, as an Idea, an eternal
dream. It was as if he could see nothing and paint
nothing else. And when a clever versatile artist of
Durant's type flings himself away in a mad struggle to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
give form and color to the invisible it is not to be wondered
at if the world is puzzled and fights shy of him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the critic who had a right to his opinion
said of him: "Now that he has thrown the reins on
the back of his imagination it will carry him far. Ten
years hence the world will realize that Maurice Durant
is a great painter. But in those ten years he must
work hard."</p>

<p>As if to show how little he cared he left off working
hard and bestirred himself for news of Frida Tancred.</p>

<p>It came at last&mdash;from Poona of all places. Frida
wrote in high spirits and at length. "I like writing to
you," she said, "because I can say what I like, because
you always know&mdash;you've been there. Where? Oh,
everywhere where I've been, except Whithorn-in-Arden.
And, now I come to think of it, you were there,
too&mdash;for a fortnight" ("three weeks&mdash;three long weeks&mdash;and
for your sake, Frida!"). "No, I'm not 'coming
home.' Why <i>must</i> I 'stop somewhere'? I can't stop,
didn't I tell you? I can only strike down where it's
deepest.</p>

<p>"It seems to be pretty deep here. If I could only
understand these people&mdash;but what European can?
They mean something we don't mean.... You
should see my Munshi, a terrifically high-caste fellow
with a diminutive figure and unfathomable eyes. I am
trying to learn Sanscrit. He is trying to teach me.
We sit opposite each other at a bamboo table with an
immense Sanscrit dictionary between us. He smiles
in his sleeve at my attempt to bridge the gulf between
Europe and Asia with a Sanscrit dictionary. He is
always smiling at me in his sleeve. I know it, and he
knows that I know it, which endears me to him very
much.</p>

<p>"My Munshi is a bottomless well of Western wisdom.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
He takes anything that Europe can give him&mdash;art, literature,
science, metaphysics. He absorbs it all, and
Heaven only knows what he is going to do with it, or
it with him. He swallows it as a juggler swallows fire,
and with about as much serious intention of assimilating
it. That smile of his intimates that the things that
matter to us do not matter to him; that nothing matters&mdash;neither
will nor conscience, nor pain nor passion,
nor man nor woman, nor life nor death. There's an
attitude for you!</p>

<p>"That attitude is my Munshi, and my Munshi is
Asia."</p>

<p>He smiled. He had seen Frida in many attitudes,
Frida in love with nothing, Frida in love with a person,
Frida in love with a thing. Here was Frida in love with
an idea. It was just like her. She was seeing Asia
from the Asiatic point of view.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile," she went on, "there's a greater gulf
fixed between my Munshi and my 'rickshaw coolie than
there is between me and my 'rickshaw coolie, or my
Munshi and me."</p>

<p>He wondered if she meant to remind him that there
was a still greater gulf between him and her.</p>

<p>"To-morrow I and two coolies are going up to Gujerat
where the famine is. I inclose a snapshot of the
party. My effacement by the coolie is merely a photographic
freak&mdash;his grin is the broadest part of him,
poor fellow. In the autumn I go down to Bombay.
I am deep in bacteriology, which reminds me of father
and the first time I met you, and your bad puns."</p>

<p>The snapshot was an unflattering likeness of Frida
in a 'rickshaw. The foreground was filled by the figure
of the grinning coolie. Behind him Frida's face showed
dim and small and far-off; she was smiling with the sun
in her eyes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span></p>

<p>Such as it was he treasured it as his dearest possession.
He had been painting pictures all his life, but
he had none of Frida.</p>

<p>Silence again. "In the autumn," she had said, "I
go down to Bombay." But the autumn passed and
there was no news of her. Durant provided himself
with an Indian outfit. He was going out to look for
her; he was ready to go to the ends of the world to
find her. "The day after to-morrow," he said, "I shall
start for Bombay."</p>

<p>That night he dreamed of her; or, rather, not of her,
but of a coolie who stood before the door of a wayside
bungalow, and held in his hands shafts that were not
the shafts of a 'rickshaw. And the coolie's face was all
one broad grin.</p>

<p>Two days later&mdash;the day he was to have sailed for
India&mdash;hurriedly skimming a column of the <i>Times</i> he
came upon the news he was looking for.</p>

<p>"It is with much regret that we record the death
from bubonic plague of Miss Frida Tancred. It was
quite recently that this lady gave up a large part of her
fortune to founding the Bacteriological Laboratory in
Bombay, more recently still that she distinguished herself
by her services to the famine-stricken population
of Gujerat. Miss Tancred has added to the immense
debt our Indian Empire owes her by this final example
of heroic self-sacrifice. It is said that she contracted
plague while nursing one of her coolies, who has since
recovered."</p>

<p>He bowed his head.</p>

<p>It was not grief he felt, but a savage exultant joy.
The world could have no more of her. She was his, in
some inviolable, irrevocable way. He knew. He
understood her now, clearly and completely.</p>

<p>His joy deepened to a passionless spiritual content;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
as if in the fulness of his knowledge he had embraced
the immortal part of her.</p>

<p>Why had he not understood her long ago? She had
never changed. As he had first seen her, playing cards
with her father in the drawing-room at Coton Manor,
as he had last seen her, pacing the deck of the <i>Windward</i>,
intoxicated with her freedom, as he saw her now,
bending her head over the plague-poisoned body of the
coolie, she was the same tender, resolute, passionate
Frida, who ruined her life and glorified it, laid it down
and took it up again at her will. And as he saw&mdash;would
always see her, in this new light of her death,
she was smiling, as if she defied him to see anything
pathetic in it.</p>

<p>She had loved the world, the mystic maddening
beauty of it, the divine darkness and glory of it. She
had taken to her heart the rapture and the pain of it.
She had stretched out her hands to the unexplored, to
the unchanged and changing, the many-faced, incomprehensible,
finite, infinite Whole.</p>

<p>And she had flung it all up; for what?</p>

<p>For a 'rickshaw coolie's life?&mdash;Or for something&mdash;yet&mdash;beyond?</p>

<p class="adheader">S. R. CROCKETT'S NEW NOVEL</p>


<div><h3>SANDY</h3>
<p class="smcap center">By S. R. CROCKETT<br/>
<br />
Author of "Patsy," "The Stickit Minister," etc.</p>

<p class="center"><i>With frontispiece in colors by R. Pearson Lawrence; decorated Cloth, 12mo,
$1.35 net; postpaid $1.47.</i></p>

<p>Up from his country home Sandy goes to London. And there he has
his great adventure. What it is and the story of his success and of his
love is told by Mr. Crockett in a fashion which will convince many
people that this is quite the most satisfactory novel he has ever written.
Full of the vigor of life, with a wit and humor that win the reader even
as they won his associates, Sandy is a cheery kind of hero and the tale
of his experiences of that inspiring type which fires men&mdash;and women,
too&mdash;on to the accomplishment of big things. No less appealing a figure
is V. V., the girl with whom Sandy falls in love and who long before the
book's close becomes his life partner. Altogether "Sandy" thrills and
exhilarates as does little of the present day fiction.</p>

<p>"There's always a good story in a Crockett novel, and has been ever
since the days of 'The Stickit Minister.' Sandy is a typical new Scot,
most modern and most masterful of all heroes in current fiction....
As winning a heroine as any one could desire is skillfully wrought into
the warp and woof of Mr. Crockett's fabric of narrative. Popular favor
is likely to score one for 'Sandy'."&mdash;<i>Phila. North American.</i></p>

<p class="adheader">NEW MACMILLAN FICTION</p>


<div><h3>The Reconnaissance</h3>
<p class="smcap center">By GORDON GARDINER</p>

<p class="center"><i>With frontispiece in colors by George Harper. Cloth, 12mo,
$1.35 net.</i></p>

<p>Unusual both in thought and in character is this briskly
moving story of adventure in which a young man ultimately
finds himself. The action is vigorous and the tale of the
youth's endeavors to overcome certain deep-rooted traits in
his nature appealing. The novel is distinguished by the
vivacity and crispness of the author's style. For the most part
Mr. Gardiner reveals his theme and portrays his people
through dialogue, thus imbuing his book with a liveliness
and an alertness which the reader will find most pleasant.
Opening on the veldt in Africa with a situation of striking
power and originality, the scene, in the course of the plot,
shifts to other lands, bringing in a variety of well-drawn and
interesting men and women. Like A. E. W. Mason's "The
Four Feathers," to which it bears a slight resemblance, "The
Reconnaissance" is a story of courage, raising in perplexing
fashion the question as to whether the winner of the Victoria
Cross is a hero or a coward, and answering it in a way likely
to be satisfactory to all.</p>

<div><h3 class="larger">Short Stories</h3>
<p class="smcap center">By JACK LONDON</p>
<p class="textright"><i>Cloth, 12 mo.</i></p>

<p>This volume representing the maturer work of Mr. London has
that compelling style, that skill in character portrayal and in the construction
of unusual plot which since he first began to write fiction
have always marked him apart from the rank and file of novelists. No
writer to-day is more praised than Mr. London for the color of his stories,
for the fertility of his imagination, for the strength of his prose, for the
way in which he makes his people live. His versatility, for he can turn
out a bit of grim tragedy or a tale brimming with humor with equal
facility, makes him everybody's author. The present book is a collection
of particularly human stories based on a variety of emotions
and worked out with consummate mastery of his art.</p>

<div><h3>The Treasure</h3>
<p class="smcap center">By KATHLEEN NORRIS</p>
<p class="smcap center">Author of "Mother," "The Rich Mrs. Burgoyne," etc.</p>
<p class="textright"><i>With illustrations. Decorated cloth, 12mo. $1.00 net.</i></p>

<p>Stories of the home circle Mrs. Norris has made peculiarly her own.
Whether the scene be laid in the parlor or the kitchen, whether the character
be mistress or maid, she writes with an understanding and sympathy
which compel admiration. In the present novel Mrs. Norris chronicles
the experiences of one family in trying to solve the servant problem!
What they do, with the results, not only provide reading that is amusing
but will be found by many who look beneath the surface, highly suggestive
and significant. As in all of Mrs. Norris's work, the atmosphere
of the home has been wonderfully caught; throughout are those intimate
little touches which make the incidents described seem almost a part of
the reader's own life, so close to reality, so near to the everyday happenings
of everybody does Mrs. Norris bring them.</p>

appeal to all readers who hold the word "Grannie" sacred with
their childhood and its memories.</p>

<p>"The picture it gives is sweet and wholesome, and most
pleasing."&mdash;<i>N. Y. Times.</i></p>

family of grandchildren."&mdash;<i>Boston Globe.</i></p>
